However, it misses details about the improvement with SLNTG and ASA, and resolution with heparin and nitro drips. It also includes 'pain stops with rest' and 'pain worse with walking' which are not explicitly stated in the GT's positive findings, although they are implied by 'exertional'. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'denies shortness of breath; denies sweating; denies nausea', which are all present in the GT's negative findings. However, the GT lists many more negative findings that are not included in the prediction. [RESULT]: 2"

        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction 'denies heart problems; family healthy' is a partial match to the GT's specific denial of early MI, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathies, and sudden cardiac death. It captures the general idea of no significant cardiac family history but lacks the detail. [RESULT]: 3",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction 'denies chronic conditions; denies heart problems' is a reasonable interpretation of 'No significant past medical history', focusing on the absence of major health issues. [RESULT]: 3",

        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction captures the core information of substernal chest pain on exertion starting 2 days ago while shoveling, which is the main point of the GT. It adds details like 'pressure-like' and 'middle of chest' which are consistent with the GT's description. [RESULT]: 4",

The GT lists several specific antibiotics including Amoxicillin, Amox/amp/cephalosporins with an anaphylactic reaction and hypotension. While the prediction captures the class of drugs and the type of reaction (hypotension), it doesn't list all the specific allergies mentioned in the GT. [RESULT]: 3",

        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction mentions 'Lung infection (3 months ago)' and 'Pee infection (3 months ago)'. The GT mentions 'Hospitalization 3 months prior for PNA/UTI/anaphylaxis'. PNA is a lung infection and UTI is a pee infection. The prediction captures these two events from the GT, but misses the other significant medical history items like Dementia, Aspiration, Anaphylactic allergy, COPD, HTN, Depression, GERD, and Hypothyroidism. [RESULT]: 2",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT lists 'Dyspnea, Hypoxia'. The prediction lists 'Trouble breathing; Fever; Cough; Leg pain; Confusion'.

The prediction captures shortness of breath (trouble breathing), fever, cough productive of sputum, more confused, and pain in thighs (leg pain). It adds 'Tired sometimes' which is not in the GT. It misses the specific oxygen saturation value (88% on RA on arrival). Overall, it captures most of the key positive findings. [RESULT]: 3",

The prediction lists a much longer list of negative symptoms, including some that are not in the GT (Chills, Fatigue, Changes in appetite, etc.). It does not explicitly list 'urinary symptoms', 'diarrhea', 'SOB', or 'CP' as negative findings, although 'Trouble breathing' is listed as positive.

It also includes some findings not explicitly listed in the GT positive findings (not sleeping well, not eating much, tired, no energy, wants to sleep) but these could be inferred from the overall presentation. It accurately captures the suicide ideation without plan. It misses the nonproductive/productive cough distinction and the subjective nature of the fevers/chills from the GT. [RESULT]: 3"

It misses Hypercholesterolemia and the specific details of the transplant and stent. [RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction 'Pain when urinating; Burning when urinating' is semantically equivalent to 'Dysuria', which means painful or difficult urination, often described as burning. [RESULT]: 4",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The prediction '3' is an exact match for the GT value 3. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists all the medications mentioned in the GT, using either the generic or brand name as provided. [RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction captures the key positive symptoms mentioned in the GT, including burning with urination, burning above the bladder, onset yesterday, increased frequency, and chills this morning. [RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction lists several negative symptoms, but only 'Fever' is directly mentioned in the GT's negative findings ('denies fevers'). The other items in the prediction are not present in the GT's negative list. [RESULT]: 2"

        "children": "[REASON]: The prediction only mentions the current child in the NICU and omits the detailed obstetric history (G4P0, previous pregnancies, and their outcomes) provided in the GT. While it mentions one child, it lacks the crucial context of the patient's parity and prior pregnancy history.\n[RESULT]: 2",

        "allergies": "[REASON]: The prediction lists the same allergies as the GT, although it omits 'Derived' from 'Shellfish Derived'. This is a minor difference and the core allergens are captured.\n[RESULT]: 4",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction lists most of the key medical history items from the GT, including depression, bipolar, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, D&C, pyelonephritis, ectopic pregnancy, miscarriage, cerclage, and suicide attempt (implied by h/o SA). It omits the detail about rheumatoid arthritis having no current medications and the specifics of the asthma hospitalization as a child, but captures the major conditions.\n[RESULT]: 4",
        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction states that the patient denies significant family history, which is semantically equivalent to the GT stating it is non-contributory.\n[RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction captures several key positive findings from the GT, including right side pain, left side pain (radiating), lower right side pain (RLQ), strong pain (implied by pain score), pain worse with breathing, constant pain for days, fever, nausea, vomiting yellow stuff, and decreased appetite. It omits details like the highest fever temperature, last BM, prior ED visit specifics, prior CTU findings, and the worsening of symptoms on Cipro, but captures the main symptoms.\n[RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction states 'side pain', which is a less specific term than 'Flank pain' used in the GT. While flank pain is a type of side pain, the GT is more precise.\n[RESULT]: 3",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The prediction accurately states the pain score as 10, which matches the GT.\n[RESULT]: 4",

It misses some details like the bilateral flank pain and the radiation of pain. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction lists several negative findings, some of which are present in the GT (vomiting, diarrhea). However, it includes many negative findings not mentioned in the GT and misses others that are in the GT (cough, vision changes, SOB, DOE, wheeze, confusion, weakness, numbness, paresthesias).

        "tobacco": "[REASON]: The prediction accurately reflects that the patient is a former smoker who quit. The phrasing is semantically equivalent. [RESULT]: 4",
        "alcohol": "[REASON]: The prediction mentions drinking wine sometimes, which aligns with the GT's 'Occasional social drinking; Wine; Infrequent'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "illicit_drug": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Not recorded', while the prediction states 'denies use'. While 'denies use' is a common way to record this, 'Not recorded' implies the information wasn't obtained or documented. They are not semantically equivalent. [RESULT]: 2",
        "allergies": "[REASON]: The prediction states 'denies allergies', which is semantically equivalent to 'No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction captures the key information about the mother and brother having heart problems and the brother having heart surgery, which aligns with the GT's details about premature coronary artery disease, angina, leukemia, and CABG. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medical_device": "[REASON]: The prediction mentions a 'tube (catheter) placed recently', which is a general description of a Foley catheter. It captures the presence of a medical device related to the urinary system. [RESULT]: 3",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction only mentions kidney stones, blood in urine, and recent hospitalization for blood in urine. The GT lists a much more extensive medical history. The prediction is incomplete. [RESULT]: 2",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT lists 'Hematuria'. The prediction lists 'blood in urine; lower stomach pain'. While blood in urine is the same as hematuria, the prediction includes lower stomach pain which is listed in the present illness positive section of the GT, not the chief complaint. [RESULT]: 3",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The GT indicates a pain score of 0. The prediction also indicates a pain score of 0. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists most of the medications from the GT, although it omits some supplements and the specific brand name for aspirin and metoprolol. It captures the core prescribed medications. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction captures the key positive symptoms mentioned in the GT, such as worsening hematuria (blood in urine getting worse, sees clots), lower abdominal pain (dull lower stomach pain), inability to void/difficulty voiding (trouble peeing, hard to go), and clots. [RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Not recorded'. The prediction provides a list of denied symptoms. These are not consistent. [RESULT]: 1"

        "medical_device": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Not recorded', while the prediction includes 'dialysis (three times a week)'. This is a significant piece of information related to the patient's medical history (ESRD on HD) and is a medical device/treatment. The prediction provides relevant information not explicitly in the GT for this specific key, but derived from the overall context. [RESULT]: 2",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction includes 'pneumonia; shingles; liver problems; HCV; cirrhosis; kidney problems'. This covers several key aspects of the GT medical history (community acquired pneumonia, shingles, HCV, HCV cirrhosis, ESRD on HD, kidney transplant). It misses HTN, T2DM, HIV/AIDS, and esophageal varices. [RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction 'stomach pain' is semantically equivalent to 'Abd pain'. [RESULT]: 4",

        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'amitriptyline; amlodipine; carvedilol; pravastatin; insulin'. The GT lists 'amitriptyline, amlodipine, ammonium lactate, aspirin, carvedilol, cholecalciferol (vitamin D3), dapsone, docusate sodium [Colace], insulin glargine [Lantus U-100 Insulin], mycophenolate mofetil, Novolog, oxycodone, pravastatin, tacrolimus'. The prediction includes some correct medications but misses many others and only includes 'insulin' instead of the specific types. [RESULT]: 2",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction includes 'stomach pain (started four days ago; low down; dull; comes and goes; goes to back sometimes); felt sick to stomach sometimes; threw up (two days ago)'. This covers generalized abdominal pain 4 days duration, suprapubic pain worse (low down), back radiation, intermittent pain, vomiting 2 days ago, and intermittent nausea (felt sick to stomach sometimes).

The GT includes 'diarrhea; fevers; chills; sick contacts; chest pain; shortness of breath; vomiting yesterday/today'. The prediction covers fever, diarrhea, and not provoked by eating/walking (changes in pain with eating or walking). It misses chills, sick contacts, chest pain, shortness of breath, and vomiting yesterday/today. It also includes extra negative findings not in the GT (no history of ulcers, no history of acid reflux, no history of inflammatory bowel disease, no recent stress or changes in life, no constipation).
