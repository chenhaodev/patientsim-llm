[RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction lists several denied symptoms, some of which are consistent with the GT (denies weakness/numbness in arms/legs, which relates to denying focal deficits and never having L sided weakness before). However, the prediction includes many denials not present in the GT (recent illnesses/surgeries, changes in mood/confusion, vision changes, headaches, dizziness before incident, diet/weight/energy changes, anxiety/stress, sleep patterns, bathroom habits, appetite/thirst). The GT specifically denies focal deficits, other clear deficits, inability to speak/understand, L sided weakness before, stroke/TIA symptoms, current symptoms, incontinence, and tongue bite.

It also adds 'feels a bit tired sometimes' which is not in the GT. Overall, it captures a significant portion but is not complete.\n[RESULT]: 3",

However, it misses details like RUE weakness, right arm drift, and inability to hold a pen/write, and incorrectly states symptoms are getting worse instead of improving. [RESULT]: 2",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction includes some negative findings from the GT (no pain, no trouble speaking, no changes in vision) but also includes several not present in the GT.

It misses the negative history of CAD and cancer, but the positive history is fully captured.\n[RESULT]: 3",
        "medical_device": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Not recorded'. The prediction lists 'ProAir HFA', which is a medication/inhaler, not typically classified as a medical device in this context. This is incorrect.\n[RESULT]: 1",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction 'diabetes; high blood pressure; breast cancer; asthma' captures the key conditions from the GT 'DMII; b/l breast CA s/p XRT and b/l lumpectomy on Evista; Asthma'. It misses the details about the breast cancer treatment and medication, and adds 'high blood pressure' which is not explicitly listed in the GT medical history (though it is in the family history).\n[RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT is 'R Facial numbness'. The prediction lists 'face feels funny; numbness on one side; blurry vision sometimes'. While 'numbness on one side' is related to the GT, the prediction includes additional symptoms and uses less precise language ('face feels funny').\n[RESULT]: 2",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction 'Evista; metformin; multivitamin; ProAir HFA' is an exact match to the GT 'Evista, metformin, One Daily Multivitamin, ProAir HFA', allowing for minor variations in phrasing ('multivitamin' vs 'One Daily Multivitamin').\n[RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction captures several key positive symptoms from the GT (numbness on one side of face, blurry vision, tingling in face, stress about brother's diagnosis) but misses others (unstable on feet, numbness R side of tongue/neck, ambulation felt better at OSH ED).

        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction lists many negative symptoms, some of which are present in the GT (no weakness in arms or legs corresponds to no weakness in R face or hemibody, no previous similar episodes corresponds to no history of similar sx in past, no recent infections/fevers/illnesses corresponds to no recent f/c or infectious sx). However, it misses several specific negative findings from the GT (clear directional leaning, lightheadedness, dizziness, vertiginous symptoms, associated falls, diplopia, ocular pain, pain/burning/tingling with numbness, strokes, TIAs, recent sick contacts, Neurologic and General ROS negative except as noted) and includes many general negative findings not explicitly stated in the GT.\n[RESULT]: 2"

The GT mentions 'brief dizzy spell while sitting' and 'light headedness' which are covered by 'dizziness' and 'fell upon standing' which is covered by 'fell when standing up'. The prediction adds 'started this morning after nap' which is consistent with the GT's mention of symptoms upon waking from a nap. [RESULT]: 4",

The GT mentions 'two episodes over past 10 days; body heavy; going to black out; lightheaded; dizzy; episodes lasted ~1 min; worsening dyspnea with climbing stairs over past two weeks'. There is overlap in 'body heavy', 'dizzy', and 'onset 10 days ago', and symptoms related to climbing stairs. However, the prediction misses details like 'going to black out', episode duration, and explicitly mentions 'lower energy levels' instead of 'worsening dyspnea'. [RESULT]: 3",

It also includes some details not in the GT (pain worse with deep breath, pain started as dull ache, pain feels like squeezing, little swelling on the right side of abdomen, bit of post-nasal drip, low back pain, feels more tired than usual, wakes up feeling drained) and misses specific details like flank pain, right flank pain location/radiation, one small episode NBNB emesis, regular bowel movements, and the vital signs/exam findings (bp, HR, temp, O2 sat, guarding). [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction includes denials of changes in bowel movements, diarrhea, and constipation, which are not explicitly denied in the GT's negative symptoms but are related to the positive symptom of 'regular bowel movements'. It misses the denials related to urination (pain, frequency, urgency) and the denial that the pain is the same type as previous nephrolithiasis episodes. It also includes denials not present in the GT (fever, swelling besides on right side, weight loss, recent travel, unusual food experiences). [RESULT]: 2"

It omits ESRD HIVAN and mentions UTIs before transplant, which is not in the GT. However, the core conditions are captured. [RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT lists 'FEVER,H/A'. The prediction lists 'tired; fever; burning urination'. Only 'fever' is common. 'H/A' (headache) is missing, and 'tired' and 'burning urination' are added. [RESULT]: 2",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists Truvada and Prograf, which are in the GT. It also mentions Tylenol (not in GT) and 'some others for conditions' which is vague and doesn't list the majority of medications in the GT. [RESULT]: 2",

The prediction lists tired (similar to malaise), fever (around 101 degrees, similar to FUO 101), burning urination (similar to terminal dysuria), urine smells strong, very tired all the time, hasn’t slept well, always stressed out.
