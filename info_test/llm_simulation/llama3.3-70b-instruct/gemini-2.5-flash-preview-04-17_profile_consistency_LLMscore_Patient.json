        "medical_device": "[REASON]: The prediction mentions 'stent', which is a key component of the medical device described in the GT (DES x1 to mid-LAD stenosis). While the prediction is less specific, it captures the presence of a stent. [RESULT]: 3",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction lists several conditions mentioned in the GT (heart attack, stent placement, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, asthma, back pain). It misses 'intermittent' for asthma and 'low' for back pain, but the main conditions are present and semantically equivalent. [RESULT]: 4",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'chest pain' and 'cough', which are the exact chief complaints listed in the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The prediction provides the same pain score (4) as the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists several medications from the GT (Albuterol, atenolol, losartan, simvastatin). It misses codeine-guaifenesin, fluticasone, Mucinex, and prednisone, and generalizes fluticasone [Flovent HFA] to 'asthma inhalers'. Therefore, it is only partially correct. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction includes sudden severe chest pain, cough (with duration and sputum color), and trouble breathing, which are present in the GT. It adds dizziness and some details about the chest pain (worse with deep breath, pressure, resting helps a little) which are not in the GT. It misses transient chest pressure and chest discomfort at rest or playing cards. It is partially consistent. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction lists negative findings (swelling in legs, recent cold or flu, weight change) that are not present in the GT.

        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'heart disease; aortic stenosis; high blood pressure; high cholesterol; one vessel disease'. The GT lists 'Aortic stenosis (severe, last valve area 0.8cm); HTN; HLD; Hypothyroidism; BPH; B12 deficiency; 1 vessel disease (~ years ago), declined stent; taking aspirin 162mg daily since then'. The prediction captures some key conditions (aortic stenosis, HTN/high blood pressure, HLD/high cholesterol, 1 vessel disease/heart disease) but misses others (Hypothyroidism, BPH, B12 deficiency) and the details about the severity of aortic stenosis and the 1 vessel disease. [RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction 'chest pain with walking' is a more specific description of the chief complaint than the GT 'Chest pain', but it is still consistent with the information provided in the present illness. [RESULT]: 3",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The prediction '0; 8-9 when it happens' provides more detail about the pain score than the GT '0'. While the GT only gives the current pain score, the prediction includes the pain score when it occurs, which is relevant context. [RESULT]: 3",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'nitroglycerin; aspirin; amlodipine; atenolol; levothyroxine; simvastatin; vitamin B12; lorazepam; fish oil'. The GT lists 'amlodipine-benazepril, aspirin, atenolol, levothyroxine, Nitroglycerin, lorazepam, cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12), simvastatin, Fish Oil'. The prediction is missing 'benazepril' which is part of the combination medication amlodipine-benazepril. It also uses 'vitamin B12' instead of 'cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12)', which is semantically equivalent. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'chest discomfort with walking one block; happening more often; discomfort not sharp; discomfort in chest; discomfort relieved by nitroglycerin and resting; discomfort lasts a few minutes'.

The prediction captures the chest discomfort with walking one block and increased frequency, but misses the details about the wife's condition and the patient's emotional state related to it, which are included in the GT's positive findings. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'no pain in arms or back; no shortness of breath; no dizziness; no sweating'. The GT lists 'radiation of chest discomfort; SOB; palpitations; nausea; radiating pain; orthopnea; PND; leg swelling; calf pain; prior history of stroke; prior history of TIA; deep venous thrombosis; pulmonary embolism; bleeding at the time of surgery; myalgias; joint pains; cough; hemoptysis; black stools; red stools; recent fevers; recent chills; recent rigors; exertional buttock pain; exertional calf pain; ankle edema; syncope; presyncope'.

        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction 'denies heart problems; denies young onset heart issues' covers the core meaning of the GT 'No family history of early MI; arrhythmia; cardiomyopathies; sudden cardiac death' by denying significant cardiac issues, especially early onset ones. [RESULT]: 3",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction lists specific conditions that the patient denies, which is a more detailed way of stating 'No significant past medical history'. While not an exact match, it provides supporting details for the GT. [RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction 'chest pain' is an exact match for the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The GT states '0' for pain, likely referring to the pain level at rest. The prediction provides a more detailed description of pain levels, including '6 or 7 when it happens' and '0 at rest'. This is more informative and includes the GT value. [RESULT]: 3",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction 'aspirin daily' includes 'aspirin' which is in the GT. It adds 'daily' which is not in the GT but is a common frequency for aspirin use. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction includes 'chest pain', 'started two days ago', 'started when shoveling', and 'pain with exertion (shoveling, walking fast)', which are all present in the GT 'substernal chest pain on exertion (onset 2 days ago while shoveling); continued chest pain only on exertion'. It also adds 'pressure-like pain', 'pain resolves with rest', and 'first time experiencing chest pain' which are not in the GT. [RESULT]: 3",

        "medical_device": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Not recorded', while the prediction lists 'stent'. The medical history in the GT mentions a stent, so while not explicitly listed as a 'medical device' in the GT, it is present in the overall profile. However, the GT specifically states 'Not recorded' for this key. [RESULT]: 2",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction lists several key medical history items from the GT (heart problems, heart attack, stent, breast cancer, lumpectomy, chemotherapy, radiation) but misses others like HTN, HLD, and GERD. [RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT lists 'Chest pain' as the chief complaint. The prediction lists 'chest pain; cough'. While chest pain is included, the addition of cough makes it partially inconsistent with the GT's single chief complaint. [RESULT]: 3",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The prediction provides the same pain score as the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists several medications from the GT (atorvastatin, omeprazole, acetaminophen, vitamin D, multivitamin, low-dose aspirin) but misses others like calcium carbonate-vitamin D3, clindamycin HCl, ketoconazole, and omeprazole-sodium bicarbonate (though omeprazole is listed).

The deaths are not mentioned in the prediction. [RESULT]: 3",
        "medical_device": "[REASON]: The ground truth states 'Not recorded', while the prediction mentions a 'Sleep apnea machine (not used)'. This is a discrepancy, as the GT indicates no device was recorded, while the prediction identifies one. [RESULT]: 1",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction lists Gout, Restless legs, and Sleep apnea, which are present in the GT. It also mentions 'Stomach problems' which is a general term for GERD. HTN and HLD are missing. [RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction provides the exact chief complaint as the ground truth. [RESULT]: 4",

However, the core allergens are present. [RESULT]: 3",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction includes several key medical history items from the ground truth (Diabetes, high blood pressure, stroke, gastric bypass surgery, gallbladder removed, depression, hears voices). It misses OSA, Anemia (mentioned twice in GT), Hypomagnesia, GERD, Bradycardia, and appy. It also simplifies CVA to stroke, PSxH to specific surgeries, and DM to Diabetes, which are acceptable semantic equivalents. [RESULT]: 3",

The prediction is a good summary of the key medical history points. [RESULT]: 4",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT lists 'Dyspnea, Hypoxia'. The prediction lists 'Trouble breathing; fever; cough'. While 'Trouble breathing' is related to dyspnea/hypoxia, the prediction includes fever and cough which are listed under present illness positive in the GT, not the chief complaint. The prediction misses hypoxia entirely. [RESULT]: 2",

The ground truth states 'Denies pain with urination', 'Denies increased frequency (urination)', 'Denies urgency (urination)', and 'Does not feel pain is same type as previous nephrolithiasis episodes'. There is overlap with the pain being different from kidney stones, but the prediction includes negatives not in the GT (fever, swelling, travel, stress) and misses the urinary negatives.
