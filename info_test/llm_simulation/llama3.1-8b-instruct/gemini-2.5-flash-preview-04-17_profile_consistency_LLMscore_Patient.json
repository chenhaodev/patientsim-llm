        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction 'stomach pain; no bowel movement or gas passed' captures the main complaint of abdominal pain and adds the related symptoms of no bowel movement or gas, which are highly relevant to the chief complaint in this context. The GT is simply 'ABDO PAIN'. The prediction is more detailed but still accurate in identifying the core issue. [RESULT]: 3",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The ground truth indicates the presence of pain but does not provide a numerical rating (0 is likely a placeholder or error in the GT). The prediction provides a numerical rating of '6', which is a common way to quantify pain. While the GT is unclear, the prediction provides a plausible and relevant piece of information about the pain severity. Given the ambiguity of the GT's '0', a direct comparison is difficult, but the prediction's '6' is a valid and common way to describe pain. [RESULT]: 2",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists several medications that are present in the ground truth (amlodipine, metformin, metoprolol, aspirin, calcium, vitamin D), but misses others (enalapril maleate, alendronate, latanoprost, atorvastatin). It also lists 'calcium; vitamin D' separately while the GT has 'Calcium 500 + D'. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction includes several positive findings from the GT (abdominal pain >12 hours, no bowel movement >36 hours, no flatus >36 hours, nausea, vomiting) but also includes additional details about the pain location, character, and exacerbating/alleviating factors, as well as details about bowel movements that are not explicitly in the GT. It misses the history of multiple SBO's and increased frequency. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'fever' which is in the GT ('fevers'). It misses 'chills', 'chest pain', and 'shortness of breath' from the GT and includes 'weight loss' and 'changes in bowel movement color/consistency besides hardness/dryness' which are not in the GT.

This is significantly different from the detailed list in the GT, missing many key conditions like Afib, COPD, CHF, HTN, PE, and UTI hospitalization. It also includes conditions not in the GT (Pneumonia, bad cold). [RESULT]: 1",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'Fever; cough; runny nose'. The GT lists 'FEVER COUGH'. The prediction includes the two main complaints and adds 'runny nose', which is mentioned in the HPI but not explicitly as a chief complaint in the GT. [RESULT]: 3",

The GT lists 'Ampicillin; Haldol; Demerol; Nortriptyline; Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics); Amoxicillin; Amox/amp/cephalosporins (anaphylactic reaction, hypotension)'. The prediction correctly identifies Ampicillin and Haldol. 'Other antibiotics' is a partial match for the various antibiotics listed in the GT (Amoxicillin, Amox/amp/cephalosporins, Sulfa). However, it misses Demerol and Nortriptyline. [RESULT]: 3",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'seizures; depression; dementia; COPD'.

The GT lists 'shortness of breath; fever (to 100.5); cough productive of sputum; more confused; 88% on RA on arrival; pain in thighs'. 'Trouble breathing' and 'getting winded easily' are related to 'shortness of breath'. 'Coughing a lot' and 'coughing up yellow stuff' are related to 'cough productive of sputum'. 'High fever, 100.5 degrees' matches 'fever (to 100.5)'. 'Feeling more confused than usual' matches 'more confused'. 'Pain in thighs, dull ache, for a few days' matches 'pain in thighs'. The prediction includes 'feeling tired' and 'feeling a bit chilly' which are not explicitly in the GT's positive symptoms. The prediction misses '88% on RA on arrival'.

The GT lists 'urinary symptoms; diarrhea; SOB; CP'. The prediction correctly identifies 'chest pain' ('CP'). It misses 'urinary symptoms' and 'diarrhea'. The prediction includes many negative symptoms not mentioned in the GT. The GT lists 'SOB' as negative, which contradicts the positive findings and chief complaint, suggesting a potential error in the GT itself, but based on the provided GT, the prediction does not list 'SOB' as negative.

The prediction lists 'atrial fibrillation; heart disease; arm fracture'. The prediction captures some key elements (atrial fibrillation, arm fracture) but misses many others and uses a general term 'heart disease' instead of specific conditions like hypertension, dyslipidemia, and mitral valve prolapse. It's partially correct but significantly incomplete. [RESULT]: 2",

The prediction lists 'trouble breathing; winded easily; wheezing when breathing out; coughing up white phlegm; breathing difficulty worse with activity; weight gain; tired; legs and feet swelling sometimes; dizzy sometimes when standing up too fast; heart beats weird sometimes; decreased appetite'. The prediction captures the core symptoms of breathing difficulty, wheezing, coughing up phlegm, and worsening with activity. However, it adds several symptoms not mentioned in the GT (weight gain, tired, leg/feet swelling, dizziness, heart beats weird, decreased appetite) and misses the detail about needing to sit down and the grandson being sick. It's partially correct but includes extra information and misses some details. [RESULT]: 3",

The prediction lists 'chest pain; chest tightness; fever; chills; recent changes in sleep patterns; palpitations'. The prediction includes denial of fever and chills, which is consistent with the GT. However, it also includes denial of chest pain, chest tightness, recent changes in sleep patterns, and palpitations, which were not explicitly mentioned as denied in the GT's 'all other systems negative'. While 'all other systems negative' is broad, the prediction specifies certain denials. It's partially consistent but adds details not explicitly in the GT. [RESULT]: 3"

The prediction captures many of the positive symptoms (pain location/radiation, fever, vomiting, pain with breathing, nausea, no BM for one week, increased urination frequency) but misses details like duration, worsening, specific temperature, poor PO intake, HA, and the history of prior ED visit/UTI/CTU/cipro. It also adds dizziness, fatigue, and worry about the baby, which are not explicitly listed as positive symptoms in the GT's HPI section. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'jaundice; changes in urine color; unusual vaginal discharge; vaginal bleeding'. The GT lists 'CP; burning/urgency (voiding)'. The negative findings listed in the prediction are completely different from those in the GT. [RESULT]: 1"

        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction lists the STIs and HTN mentioned in the GT, and also includes depression, which is not explicitly stated in the GT's medical history but could be inferred from the Wellbutrin medication. However, based on the provided GT medical history, it's a partial match. [RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction lists back pain and abdomen pain, which are the main components of the chief complaint in the GT. It also adds 'urinary problems', which is related to the present illness but not the core chief complaint as stated in the GT. [RESULT]: 3",

        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists all the medications mentioned in the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction captures several key positive findings from the GT, such as the duration and location of pain, radiation, chills, fever, nausea, and malodorous urine.

[RESULT]: 4",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction provides a very generalized summary of the medical history (urinary tract infection; prostate problem; kidney issues; heart problem; heart surgery) and misses many specific conditions listed in the GT. [RESULT]: 2",
