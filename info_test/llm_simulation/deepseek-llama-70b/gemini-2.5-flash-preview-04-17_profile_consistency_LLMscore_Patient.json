        "tobacco": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Not recorded', while the prediction states 'denies smoking'. These are different and not semantically equivalent in this context. 'Not recorded' means the information wasn't documented, whereas 'denies smoking' means the patient was asked and stated they don't smoke. However, in the context of a patient profile, 'denies smoking' is a reasonable inference if the information was not recorded but the patient was likely asked. It's a plausible interpretation of missing data in a clinical setting, leaning towards a partially correct interpretation of the likely underlying status rather than a strict adherence to the 'Not recorded' documentation status. Given the common practice of documenting negative responses to substance use questions, 'denies smoking' is a likely scenario if the information wasn't explicitly recorded as 'denied'. Therefore, it's partially correct in representing the likely patient status, even if not the exact documentation status. [RESULT]: 3",
        "alcohol": "[REASON]: Similar to tobacco, the GT states 'Not recorded', while the prediction states 'denies drinking alcohol'. For the same reasons as the tobacco entry, 'denies drinking alcohol' is a plausible interpretation of missing data in a clinical setting and represents the likely patient status, even if not the exact documentation status. [RESULT]: 3",
        "illicit_drug": "[REASON]: Similar to tobacco and alcohol, the GT states 'Not recorded', while the prediction states 'denies using drugs'. For the same reasons as the tobacco and alcohol entries, 'denies using drugs' is a plausible interpretation of missing data in a clinical setting and represents the likely patient status, even if not the exact documentation status. [RESULT]: 3",
        "allergies": "[REASON]: The GT states 'No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions', and the prediction states 'No allergies'. These are semantically equivalent. [RESULT]: 4",
        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Father with CAD'. The prediction states 'Father had coronary artery disease; no strokes'. The prediction correctly identifies the father having CAD, which is the key information in the GT. The addition of 'no strokes' is extra information not present in the GT, but the core information about the father's CAD is present and accurate. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The GT lists several medical conditions: HTN, CAD s/p BMS, AFib on coumadin, CHF with EF 45%, HL, falls (due to \"imbalance\", stopped playing tennis), multifactorial gait d/o, anemia, BPH, BMS stent to LAD. The prediction lists: AFib, heart stent, heart failure, anemia, issues with falls and balance, three previous falls (unsteady, tripped on curb, walked too fast). The prediction captures AFib, heart stent (related to CAD s/p BMS and BMS stent to LAD), heart failure (related to CHF with EF 45%), anemia, and issues with falls and balance (related to falls, multifactorial gait d/o). It also elaborates on the previous falls mentioned in the present illness section, which is relevant to the medical history of falls. While it doesn't explicitly list HTN, HL, or BPH, it captures the major cardiovascular and fall-related issues. It's a good summary of the key medical history points related to the chief complaint. [RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT states 'S/P FALL'. The prediction lists 'fell down; shaky hands; slurring words; weak on one side'. The prediction includes the fall, which is the primary chief complaint, but also includes associated symptoms that are part of the present illness. While the GT is a concise chief complaint, the prediction provides a more detailed description of the presenting issue, incorporating key symptoms. It's partially correct as it includes the fall, but adds details that are typically part of the HPI. [RESULT]: 3",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The GT states '0'. The prediction states '0'. These are exact matches. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The GT lists: aspirin, lisinopril, metoprolol succinate, multivitamin, omeprazole, simvastatin, Viagra, warfarin. The prediction lists: aspirin; lisinopril; metoprolol; multivitamin; omeprazole; simvastatin; Viagra; warfarin. The prediction lists all the medications from the GT, although it shortens 'metoprolol succinate' to 'metoprolol'. This is a minor difference and the core medication is identified. [RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The GT lists numerous positive findings related to the fall and associated symptoms. The prediction lists some of these findings: fell down, shaky hands, slurring words (wife reported), weak on one side (left leg). It also includes 'shaking stopped after a few minutes', 'weakness went away', 'feels more tired than usual', and 'doesn't sleep as well as used to', which are not explicitly in the GT's positive findings for this specific episode, although fatigue and sleep issues might be related to the patient's overall condition. The prediction misses many details from the GT, such as being found on the floor, the timeline of the fall, pulling down the curtain rod, EMS concern, the history of previous falls (which is partially covered in the medical history prediction), driving status, and last seen well time. It captures some key points but is not comprehensive. [RESULT]: 2",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The GT lists negative findings: denied any focal deficits (patient), no other clear deficits (wife), able to speak and understand wife well, never had L sided weakness before, never had symptoms consistent with stroke or TIA, currently denies any symptoms, did not have incontinence after this episode, did not have tongue bite after this episode, never had history of seizures. The prediction lists: no pain, no similar episodes of shaking and weakness, no recent illnesses, no recent surgeries, no anxiety, no depression, no changes in vision, no changes in coordination, no recent changes in diet, no recent changes in fluid intake, no near-falls, no numbness, no tingling. There is very little overlap between the GT and prediction for negative findings. The prediction includes many general negative findings that are not specifically mentioned in the GT's negative findings for this episode. The only potential overlap is 'no similar episodes of shaking and weakness' which relates to 'never had symptoms consistent with stroke or TIA' and 'never had L sided weakness before', but it's a broad statement.

'High blood pressure' is equivalent to 'HTN', 'High cholesterol' is equivalent to 'hypercholesterolemia', and 'Achalasia (treated)' is equivalent to 'Achalasia s/p dilatation'. 'Mild dementia' is also included. The GT also includes 'gait instability' which is not explicitly mentioned in the prediction's medical history, but is mentioned in the chief complaint/present illness. [RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT states 'LEFT SIDED WEAKNESS'. The prediction states 'Left arm weakness; Difficulty walking'. While left arm weakness is part of left-sided weakness, the prediction is more specific and also includes difficulty walking, which is related to gait instability mentioned in the GT's medical history. It captures the essence but is not an exact match. [RESULT]: 3",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The prediction '0' is the exact value as the GT '0'. [RESULT]: 4",

The GT includes 'Worsening left arm weakness; new left arm weakness upon wakening; continued symptoms; could not walk; decreased grip strength left hand; increased weakness throughout day'. The prediction captures the key aspects of left arm weakness and difficulty walking/inability to walk and their worsening nature, which aligns well with the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Not recorded'. The prediction provides a detailed list of denied symptoms. This is a significant difference. [RESULT]: 1"

        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction mentions 'no history of heart disease', 'no history of stroke', and 'no history of diabetes'. The GT lists specific cardiac conditions (MI, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathies, sudden cardiac death) and neurologic disorder (stroke). While the prediction covers stroke, it generalizes the cardiac conditions to 'heart disease' and adds diabetes which was not in the GT for family history. It's partially correct but misses the specificity of the GT. [RESULT]: 2",
        "medical_device": "[REASON]: The GT lists 'mechanical mitral valve prosthesis' and 'ventricular pacer'. The prediction lists 'oxygen (sometimes)'. These are completely different medical devices. [RESULT]: 1",

It's partially correct in that it indicates no significant family history for relevant conditions, but it's not the exact phrase.\n[RESULT]: 3",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction lists most of the conditions mentioned in the GT, including HTN (High blood pressure), DMII (diabetes), hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol), asthma, osteoporosis, cervical cancer, carcinoid tumor, hysterectomy, small bowel resection, and bowel obstructions (multiple (p)SBO's). It also includes 'cervicectomy', which is related to cervical cancer/hysterectomy. The prediction accurately captures the key medical history items.\n[RESULT]: 4",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT lists 'ABDO PAIN'. The prediction lists 'Abdominal pain; no bowel movement; no passing gas; nausea; vomiting'. The prediction includes the main chief complaint (abdominal pain) and adds other significant symptoms that are part of the present illness but not typically listed as the sole chief complaint. It is partially correct as it includes the main complaint, but adds extra information.\n[RESULT]: 3",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The GT provides a numerical pain score of 0. The prediction describes the pain as 'Similar to past bowel problems (predicted)'. These are completely different types of information. The prediction does not provide a pain score.\n[RESULT]: 1",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists all the medications mentioned in the GT, using slightly different but easily recognizable names (e.g., enalapril maleate vs enalapril, Calcium 500 + D vs calcium with D). The list is complete and accurate.\n[RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction captures most of the positive findings from the GT, including abdominal pain duration and location (epigastric/upper middle abdomen), lack of bowel movement and flatus duration, history of SBOs and increased frequency, pain with oral intake, nausea, and vomiting (gastric content). It also adds 'poor appetite' and 'upper abdomen tenderness', which are consistent with the overall picture. It accurately reflects the key positive findings.\n[RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The GT lists 'fevers; chills; chest pain; shortness of breath'. The prediction lists 'No weight changes; no fever; no chills; no changes in urine; no recent stress or changes in routine; no blood or bile in vomit; no recent imaging studies before ED visit'. The prediction includes 'no fever' and 'no chills' which are in the GT, but misses 'chest pain' and 'shortness of breath'. It also includes several negative findings not present in the GT. It is partially correct as it includes some of the GT items, but is not complete and includes extra information.\n[RESULT]: 3"

Overall, it captures the key medical history points.\n[RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction only lists 'Chest pain', while the GT includes 'Chest pain, NSTEMI'. The prediction is partially correct but misses a key part of the chief complaint.\n[RESULT]: 3",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The GT states the pain is 0. The prediction gives a range of pain levels over time, including 0 now. While it provides more detail, it does include the current pain level as 0, which is consistent with the GT.\n[RESULT]: 3",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists all the medications mentioned in the GT (aspirin, nitroglycerin, sertraline) and provides additional detail about the aspirin dosage and timing, which is also present in the GT's present illness positive section.\n[RESULT]: 4",

It also includes the aspirin intake and the negative stress test, which are in the GT's positive section. It adds some details about pain being worse with movement and better with rest, which are not in the GT.\n[RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Not recorded'. The prediction provides a list of denied symptoms.

        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists all the medications present in the ground truth, with 'calcium with vitamin D' being semantically equivalent to 'calcium citrate-vitamin D3 [Citracal + D Maximum]' and 'cholecalciferol (vitamin D3)'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction includes several positive findings from the ground truth, such as worsening pain, constant pain, lower abdominal pain, burning with urination, and feeling hungry. It also includes additional details like pain started a few days ago, burning pain, feeling thirsty, going to the bathroom more often, and feeling a little worried, which are not in the ground truth. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction includes denials for nausea, vomiting, and changes in appetite (aside from feeling hungry), which are present in the ground truth. It misses denials for diarrhea, dysuria, urinary problems, and back pain. It also includes denials for changes in bowel habits, change in urine color, and weight loss, which are not in the ground truth. [RESULT]: 3"
