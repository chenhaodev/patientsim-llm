        "tobacco": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Denied current use', while the prediction states 'Quit smoking'. While related to tobacco use, 'Quit smoking' implies past use, whereas 'Denied current use' simply states no current use, which could be due to never having used or having quit. The prediction is partially correct but not an exact match. [RESULT]: 3",
        "alcohol": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Denies regular use; occasional social drink', and the prediction states 'Occasional drink, once a month'. Both indicate occasional use, making them semantically equivalent. [RESULT]: 4",

It also includes additional details not explicitly in the GT's positive findings but potentially inferred from the narrative (weakness seems a bit better, numbness hasn't changed much). [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The GT lists 'paresthesias' as negative. The prediction lists numerous negative findings, none of which are 'paresthesias'. The prediction's negative findings are not directly comparable to the single negative finding in the GT. [RESULT]: 1"

        "pain": "[REASON]: The GT states the pain score is 0. The prediction states 0; 5-6 when it happens. This indicates the pain is not constant but occurs with activity, which is a more detailed description of the pain experience. While the GT gives a single value, the prediction provides a more nuanced view of the pain score. [RESULT]: 3",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The GT lists several medications. The prediction lists some of these medications (Amlodipine-benazepril, atenolol, aspirin, levothyroxine, nitroglycerin) but misses others (lorazepam, cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12), simvastatin, Fish Oil). [RESULT]: 3",

        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists the medications mentioned in the GT (Aspirin, rosuvastatin, tamsulosin) and also includes Nitro, which was mentioned in the present illness section of the GT as being taken for pain relief. While Nitro wasn't listed under the main medication list in the GT, its inclusion in the prediction is relevant to the patient's current presentation. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction captures several key positive symptoms from the GT, including chest pain onset while unloading a truck, radiation to arms, diaphoresis (sweating), and relief with Nitro. It also adds details about the nature of the pain (pressure, heavy, tight) and that resting helped, which are not explicitly in the GT but are plausible associated symptoms. The GT mentions the pain persisted for a few hours, which is captured as 'started a few hours ago' in the prediction. The GT mentions SSCP, which is not explicitly in the prediction, but the description of the pain as pressure/heavy/tight could be considered related. [RESULT]: 3",
