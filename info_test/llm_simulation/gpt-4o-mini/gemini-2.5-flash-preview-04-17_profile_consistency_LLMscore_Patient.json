It is partially correct. [RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT is 'S/P FALL'. The prediction includes 'Fall' but also adds 'shaking in hands; weakness on left side'. While these are related to the event, the primary chief complaint as stated in the GT is the fall itself. The prediction is partially correct but includes additional information not explicitly stated as the chief complaint. [RESULT]: 3",

However, it misses several other significant conditions listed in the GT, such as recent R arm fracture, anticoagulation, cancerous polyps in colon, colon cancer, dyslipidemia, mitral valve prolapse, Lower extremity edema, Basal cell carcinoma s/p resection, and S/p hysterectomy and BSO. [RESULT]: 2",

        "alcohol": "[REASON]: The prediction 'occasional, 1-2 drinks/week' accurately reflects the GT 'Reports occasional social alcohol use; 1-2 drinks per week'. The core information is present.\n[RESULT]: 4",
        "illicit_drug": "[REASON]: The prediction 'denies drug use' is semantically equivalent to the GT 'Denies illicit drug use'. Both indicate no use of illicit drugs.\n[RESULT]: 4",
        "allergies": "[REASON]: The prediction 'penicillins' is an exact match to the GT 'Penicillins'.\n[RESULT]: 4",
        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'diabetes; high blood pressure; high cholesterol'. The GT lists 'DM (brother, mother, father); HTN (brother, mother, father); HLD; no CAD; no cancer'. The prediction captures the main conditions (DM, HTN, HLD) but misses the specific family members affected and the negative findings (no CAD, no cancer). It is partially correct.\n[RESULT]: 3",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'high blood pressure; renal failure; hypercholesterolemia; kidney transplant; history of UTIs'. The GT lists 'HTN; Renal Failure; Hypercholesterolemia; kidney transplant; Cadaveric renal transplant, right iliac fossa; double-J ureteral stent'. The prediction captures the major conditions but misses the details about the type and location of the transplant and the stent. It also adds 'history of UTIs' which is not explicitly in the GT medical history but is implied by the present illness. It is partially correct.\n[RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT lists 'Dysuria'. The prediction lists 'pain with urination; burning with urination; chills; stomach discomfort'. While dysuria is pain/burning with urination, the prediction includes additional symptoms that are part of the present illness but not the chief complaint as stated in the GT. It is partially correct.\n[RESULT]: 3",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The prediction '3' is an exact match to the GT '3'.\n[RESULT]: 4",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'losartan; metoprolol; mycophenolate mofetil; pravastatin; tacrolimus'. The GT lists 'losartan, metoprolol tartrate, mycophenolate mofetil [CellCept], pravastatin, tacrolimus [Prograf], tacrolimus'. The prediction lists all the medications but misses the specific formulation (tartrate), brand names, and the duplicate listing of tacrolimus. It is mostly correct but lacks some detail.\n[RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The GT lists 'Dysuria; suprapubic burning (started yesterday); chills (started yesterday, endorsed this morning); increased frequency of urination (started yesterday); abdominal discomfort over bladder; feels similar to past UTIs'. The prediction lists 'pain with urination; burning with urination; chills; stomach discomfort; pain in lower stomach over bladder area; symptoms started yesterday; symptoms feel similar to previous UTIs'. The prediction captures most of the positive symptoms and their timing/similarity to past UTIs, using slightly different phrasing. 'Increased frequency of urination' is missing from the prediction.\n[RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The GT lists 'no pain over transplant site; no back pain; denies fevers; denies nausea; denies vomiting; denies malaise; denies abdominal pain; denies diarrhea'. The prediction lists 'no radiation of pain; no fever; no nausea; no changes in urine color or odor; no changes in appetite; no changes in weight; normal energy levels; no recent stress; no recent changes in routine; no recent travel; no exposure to illness'. There is overlap (no fever, no nausea), but the prediction includes many negative findings not present in the GT, and misses several that are in the GT (no pain over transplant site, no back pain, denies vomiting, denies malaise, denies abdominal pain, denies diarrhea). The overlap is limited.\n[RESULT]: 2"

        "medical_device": "[REASON]: The prediction accurately identifies the cerclage, which is the medical device mentioned in the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction includes several key elements from the GT's medical history (depression, rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, cerclage, prior flank pain/UTI). However, it misses asthma, bipolar, D&C, and the detailed G4P0 history with pregnancy outcomes. [RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction states 'right side pain', which is a more general term than the GT's 'Flank pain'. While related, 'flank' is more specific. [RESULT]: 3",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The prediction provides the same pain score as the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists all the medications mentioned in the GT, omitting the brand names in brackets, which is acceptable. [RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction captures many of the positive symptoms listed in the GT, including right side pain radiating to left/RLQ, fever (with temperature), poor appetite, nausea/vomiting, increased pain with breathing, no BM in a week, frequent urination, and prior ED visit/UTI/pyelonephritis. It misses the duration of pain, worsening of pain, bright yellow vomit, HA, prior CTU, and taking PO cipro with worsening symptoms. It also adds some details not explicitly in the GT like sharp/stabbing pain, painful urination, weight loss, dark urine, and strong urine smell. Overall, it captures a significant portion but misses some specifics and adds some potentially inferred details. [RESULT]: 3"

        "allergies": "[REASON]: The prediction 'denies medication or food allergies' is a reasonable interpretation of 'No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions', although it doesn't explicitly mention drug reactions. [RESULT]: 3",
        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction accurately reflects the family medical history mentioned in the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction lists gonorrhea, chlamydia, and high blood pressure, which are all mentioned in the GT. It misses syphilis. [RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction includes 'back and stomach pain' which aligns with 'BACK AND ABD PAIN'. It also adds 'urination issues; feeling sick' which are related to the chief complaint but not the core complaint itself. [RESULT]: 3",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The prediction accurately states the pain level as '8'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists all three medications mentioned in the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction includes many of the positive findings from the GT, such as back pain, stomach pain, duration, pain level, urination issues, feeling sick, bilateral flank pain, pain radiating to lower stomach, nausea, fever, chills, sweating, trouble urinating, malodorous urine, and burning sensation with urination. It misses the specific UA findings and the history of similar flank pain. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction lists different negative findings than the GT. While these are relevant negative findings for the chief complaint, they are not the ones listed in the GT. [RESULT]: 1"

        "tobacco": "[REASON]: The prediction captures the core information that the patient is a former smoker who quit many years ago, which is semantically equivalent to the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "alcohol": "[REASON]: The prediction mentions 'wine occasionally', which aligns with the GT's 'Occasional social drinking; Wine; Infrequent'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "illicit_drug": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Not recorded', and the prediction states 'no recreational drugs'. While 'Not recorded' doesn't explicitly mean no use, in a medical context, it often implies no known history of use. The prediction's statement is a reasonable interpretation in this context. [RESULT]: 3",
        "allergies": "[REASON]: The prediction states 'no known allergies to medications or foods', which is a specific type of allergy information. The GT states 'No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions', which is broader. The prediction is partially correct but less comprehensive than the GT. [RESULT]: 3",
        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction mentions 'mother: coronary artery disease, leukemia; brother: heart surgery'. The GT lists 'Premature coronary artery disease (Mother, Brother); Mother - angina, leukemia; Brother - CABG'. The prediction captures the key conditions for the mother and brother, with 'heart surgery' being a reasonable summary of CABG. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'hematuria; urinary tract infection; BPH; other surgeries for different health issues'. The GT lists a much more extensive medical history including CAD, HTN, Hypothyroid, Nephrolithiasis, etc. The prediction only captures a few items and generalizes others. [RESULT]: 2",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Hematuria'. The prediction includes 'worsening hematuria and lower abdominal pain; difficulty voiding; clots'. While hematuria is mentioned, the prediction includes additional symptoms as the chief complaint, which is not consistent with the GT's single item. [RESULT]: 2",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The GT indicates no pain (0). The prediction indicates a pain level of '2'. These are inconsistent. [RESULT]: 1",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'allopurinol; amiodarone; aspirin; others; vitamins; supplements'. The GT lists specific medications and supplements. The prediction lists some correct medications but generalizes others as 'others', 'vitamins', and 'supplements', missing the specificity of the GT. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'worsening hematuria; lower abdominal pain; difficulty voiding; clots; increased frequency to urinate; tired'. The GT lists 'Worsening hematuria; Lower abd pain; Inability to void; Clots; Difficulty voiding'. The prediction includes most of the GT items and adds 'increased frequency to urinate' and 'tired'. 'Inability to void' and 'Difficulty voiding' are semantically similar. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Not recorded'. The prediction lists specific negative symptoms. Since the GT explicitly states 'Not recorded', any specific list of negative symptoms in the prediction is inconsistent with the GT. [RESULT]: 1"

    "29412428": {
        "occupation": "[REASON]: The prediction 'retired' is a direct and accurate representation of the GT 'Retired due to health'. The additional detail in the GT ('due to health') is not essential for the core information of being retired. [RESULT]: 4",
        "living_situation": "[REASON]: The prediction 'with partner' is semantically equivalent to the GT 'partner'. Both convey the same living arrangement. [RESULT]: 4",
        "tobacco": "[REASON]: The prediction 'denies use' is a semantically equivalent and common way to express 'Denies tobacco use'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "alcohol": "[REASON]: The prediction 'denies use' is a semantically equivalent and common way to express 'Denies alcohol use due to medical history'. The reason for denial is not included in the prediction, but the core information of denial is present. [RESULT]: 3",
        "illicit_drug": "[REASON]: The prediction 'denies use' is a semantically equivalent and common way to express 'Denies illicit drug use'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "allergies": "[REASON]: The prediction 'denies any known allergies' is a semantically equivalent and slightly more detailed way of stating 'No Known Allergies'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction 'unremarkable for kidney disease or liver disease' is a semantically equivalent and slightly rephrased version of the GT 'Unremarkable for kidney disease; Unremarkable for liver disease'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction includes some of the key medical history items (ESRD, kidney transplant, diabetes, high blood pressure) but misses several others present in the GT (HIV/AIDS, HCV, HCV cirrhosis, esophageal varices, community acquired pneumonia, shingles). [RESULT]: 2",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction 'abdominal pain' is a direct and accurate representation of the GT 'Abd pain'. 'Abd' is a common abbreviation for abdominal. [RESULT]: 4",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The prediction '8' is the exact numerical value for pain severity as provided in the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists only a subset of the medications present in the GT (insulin, amlodipine, amitriptyline, oxycodone) and misses many others. [RESULT]: 2",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction captures several key positive symptoms from the GT, including abdominal pain (with duration, severity, location, radiation, and intermittency), darker urine, and nausea. It misses the detail about vomiting 2 days ago and the periumbilical pain of months duration. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction includes some of the negative symptoms from the GT (diarrhea, fever, chills) but also includes many additional negative symptoms not present in the GT. It misses sick contacts, chest pain, shortness of breath, and vomiting yesterday/today from the GT. [RESULT]: 2"

        "living_situation": "[REASON]: The prediction accurately reflects the living situation described in the ground truth, stating the patient lives with their son.[RESULT]: 4",
        "children": "[REASON]: The prediction mentions 'Son', which is consistent with the ground truth stating '1 son'. The number is omitted but the presence of a son is captured.[RESULT]: 3",
        "tobacco": "[REASON]: The prediction states 'Denies smoking', which is semantically equivalent to 'Denies current use' in the context of tobacco use.[RESULT]: 4",
        "alcohol": "[REASON]: The prediction states 'Socially', which is a common way to describe occasional social alcohol use as mentioned in the ground truth.[RESULT]: 4",
        "illicit_drug": "[REASON]: The prediction states 'Denies use', which is a direct and accurate reflection of 'Denies illicit drug use' in the ground truth.[RESULT]: 4",
        "allergies": "[REASON]: The prediction correctly identifies 'Memantine' as the allergy listed in the ground truth.[RESULT]: 4",
        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction captures the key elements of the family medical history: Mother with stomach cancer, Father with head injury, and Son with hemochromatosis. It omits the deceased status and the negative statement about other cancers/blood disorders, but the core positive findings are present.[RESULT]: 3",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'Dementia' and 'Thyroid cancer'. The ground truth lists several other conditions including hypothyroidism, Papillary thyroid cancer, DEPRESSION, OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA, HYPERCALCEMIA, LATENT TUBERCULOSIS, NON-HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA, appendectomy, and Total thyroidectomy. The prediction is incomplete.[RESULT]: 2",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The ground truth states 'Abd pain'. The prediction states 'Lower belly pain; Burning with urination'. While lower belly pain is a type of abdominal pain, the prediction adds burning with urination which is not the chief complaint in the GT. The core chief complaint is captured but additional information is included.[RESULT]: 3",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The prediction provides the exact pain score of '8' as listed in the ground truth.[RESULT]: 4",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists Acetaminophen, Levothyroxine, Donepezil, Vitamin D, and Calcium. The ground truth lists acetaminophen, alendronate [Fosamax], calcium citrate-vitamin D3 [Citracal + D Maximum], cholecalciferol (vitamin D3), donepezil, levothyroxine, nystatin, and sertraline. The prediction captures some of the medications but misses several and groups Vitamin D and Calcium broadly.[RESULT]: 2",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction includes 'Lower belly pain, started a few days ago, getting worse, constant, burning ache, does not go away, worse with movement' and 'Burning with urination, every time; Urine darker than usual; Urine strange smell; Low energy; Poor appetite'. The ground truth lists 'recurrent worsening abdominal pain; two recent admissions for similar abdominal pain; abdominal pain refractory to acetaminophen; constant lower abdominal pain; burning with urination; hungry'. There is overlap in abdominal pain characteristics and burning with urination, but the prediction adds details not in the GT and misses some GT details like admissions and refractory pain.[RESULT]: 2",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'Sharp pain; Pain radiating to back or sides; Blood in urine; Fever; Chills; Nausea; Vomiting; Recent weight loss'. The ground truth lists 'fever/chills; changes in PO intake; nausea/vomiting; diarrhea; dysuria; urinary problems; back pain'. There is overlap with fever/chills and nausea/vomiting, but the prediction includes negatives not in the GT and misses others from the GT.[RESULT]: 2"
