        "alcohol": "[REASON]: The prediction states 'occasionally; once or twice a year', which is consistent with the GT's 'Rarely consumes alcohol'. Both indicate infrequent alcohol consumption. [RESULT]: 4",
        "allergies": "[REASON]: The prediction 'seasonal allergies' is a direct match to the GT 'seasonal'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction 'no family history of lung cancer or other serious diseases' includes the key information from the GT 'No known family history of lung cancer'. The addition of 'or other serious diseases' is extra but does not contradict the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction lists several conditions mentioned in the GT, including invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, tuberculosis, gout, prostate issues (consistent with BPH), hearing issues (consistent with hearing loss), and vertigo. It misses hyperlipidemia. However, it captures the majority of the significant conditions listed in the GT. [RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'trouble breathing; fever', which is semantically equivalent to the GT's 'Dyspnea, Fever'. [RESULT]: 4",

        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists allopurinol and tamsulosin, which are present in the GT. It misses multivitamin and omega 3-dha-epa-fish oil. It captures a significant portion of the medications listed. [RESULT]: 3",
        "arrival_transport": "[REASON]: The prediction 'came here to the emergency department' is a general statement about arrival but does not specify the mode of transport as 'WALK IN' like the GT does. It's related to arrival but not the specific method. [RESULT]: 2",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction lists many positive symptoms consistent with the GT, including trouble breathing (dyspnea/SOB), fever, chills, cough, blood in cough (hemoptysis), and feeling unwell/fatigue (constitutional sxs). It also adds sweating, decreased appetite, possible weight loss, and body aches, which are not explicitly in the GT but are plausible associated symptoms. It captures the core positive symptoms. [RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction lists chest pain, which is also in the GT. It misses dizziness, headache, abdominal pain, dysuria, and constipation from the GT and adds chest tightness, sore throat, swelling in legs or feet, changes in skin, and changes in color of lips or fingers.

        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction includes 'Trouble breathing', 'fever', 'cough', and 'confusion'. The GT lists 'Dyspnea, Hypoxia'. While 'Trouble breathing' is related to 'Dyspnea' and 'low oxygen levels' (in positive findings) is related to 'Hypoxia', the prediction adds other symptoms as chief complaints which are listed in the positive findings in the GT.

        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction covers most of the key medical history items from the GT, including CAD, stents, gastric bypass, gastrectomy, HCV, ETOH abuse, heroin abuse, HTN, HLD, and depression. It misses obesity and s/p CCY. [RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT lists 'Depression, SI'. The prediction lists 'feeling bad; cough; throwing up dark stuff; fever; chills'. These are symptoms, but not the primary chief complaint as stated in the GT. [RESULT]: 1",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists most of the medications from the GT, including bupropion, gabapentin, lisinopril, omeprazole, simvastatin, Suboxone, Tylenol PM, and Harvoni. It misses bupropion HCl and includes 'sometimes' for Tylenol PM and 'finished treatment' for Harvoni, which are minor variations. [RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction includes several positive symptoms mentioned in the GT, such as bad cough, fever, chills, felt lousy, congestion, and dark diarrhea. However, it also includes symptoms not explicitly listed in the GT's positive section (throwing up dark stuff, decreased appetite, weight loss, fatigue, trouble sleeping, shortness of breath, dark urine) and misses others (binge drinking, suicide ideation, nonproductive cough, bender, depressed mood, thoughts of suicidality, subjective fevers, productive cough). [RESULT]: 2",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The GT lists 'chills (initially); sweats (initially); chest pain; abdominal pain'. The prediction lists 'chest pain when coughing; productive cough (until last few days); asthma; bronchitis; pneumonia'. There is some overlap with chest pain, but the other items are different.

        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction captures most of the key positive symptoms from the GT, including progressively worsening SOB, severity with activity, needing to sit down to catch breath, wheezing, and coughing up white heavy phlegm. It also adds 'tired (due to poor sleep)' and 'swelling in legs/ankles', which are not explicitly in the GT but could be related symptoms. It misses the detail about the grandson being sick. Overall, it's largely consistent. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'fever', 'chills', and 'chest pain' as denied symptoms. The GT lists 'denies fever; denies chills; all other systems negative'. The prediction accurately captures the denial of fever and chills. While 'all other systems negative' is broader, the prediction's inclusion of 'chest pain' as denied is a reasonable and common negative finding to list. [RESULT]: 4"

        "alcohol": "[REASON]: The prediction uses slightly different wording ('occasionally at social events') but conveys the same meaning as 'Occasional social drinking'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "illicit_drug": "[REASON]: The prediction uses a common synonym for illicit drug use ('recreational drugs') and accurately states the absence of use. [RESULT]: 4",
        "allergies": "[REASON]: The prediction accurately states the absence of known allergies, which is the core information in the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction uses a common phrase ('nothing significant') that is semantically equivalent to 'non-contributory' in this context. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction includes several key elements from the GT's medical history (bladder cancer, resections, BCG, cystoscopic procedures, HIV) but omits others (Syphillis, UCHD, ARF, hernia repair, oral surgery, dental implant). [RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'fever' and 'painful urination', which are semantically equivalent to 'Fever' and 'Dysuria' in the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists the same medications as the GT, omitting the brand names which is acceptable. [RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction includes fever and chills, which are in the GT. It also adds more detail about the fever and includes symptoms related to dysuria (burning, cloudy, bad smelling urine) and fatigue, which are not explicitly in the GT's positive findings but are related to the chief complaint. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Not recorded', while the prediction provides a list of negative findings. There is no consistency between the two. [RESULT]: 1"

        "gender": "[REASON]: The prediction 'Female' is semantically equivalent to the GT 'F'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "living_situation": "[REASON]: The prediction 'With family' is partially correct as a spouse is family, but it lacks the specificity of 'spouse'. [RESULT]: 3",
        "tobacco": "[REASON]: The prediction 'Denies smoking' is semantically equivalent to the GT 'Denies tobacco use'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "alcohol": "[REASON]: The prediction '1-2 drinks on weekends' is semantically equivalent to the GT 'Reports occasional social alcohol use; 1-2 drinks per week'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "illicit_drug": "[REASON]: The prediction 'Denies use' is semantically equivalent to the GT 'Denies illicit drug use'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "allergies": "[REASON]: The prediction 'Penicillins (bad reaction)' contains the core information 'Penicillins' from the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction lists the same conditions and family members as the GT, using slightly different terminology (high blood pressure vs HTN, high cholesterol vs HLD). [RESULT]: 4",
        "medical_device": "[REASON]: The prediction only mentions 'Kidney transplant', which is a medical history item, not the specific 'double-J ureteral stent' listed in the GT as a device. [RESULT]: 1",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'Kidney transplant' which is in the GT, but misses several other key medical history items like HTN, Renal Failure, Hypercholesterolemia, and the double-J ureteral stent. It also includes 'recurrent UTIs (3-4 times)' and 'postmenopausal' which are not in the GT. [RESULT]: 2",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'Burning with urination; pain with urination; chills' which are related to the GT 'Dysuria' and 'chills', but 'Dysuria' is the primary chief complaint in the GT. [RESULT]: 3",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists all the medications present in the GT, using slightly abbreviated names for some. [RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'Burning with urination (started yesterday); chills (yesterday and this morning); increased urinary frequency; urinary urgency; bladder pressure/pain'. This aligns well with the GT's 'Dysuria; suprapubic burning (started yesterday); chills (started yesterday, endorsed this morning); increased frequency of urination (started yesterday); abdominal discomfort over bladder; feels similar to past UTIs'. 'Burning with urination' is equivalent to 'Dysuria' and 'suprapubic burning', 'increased urinary frequency' is the same, and 'bladder pressure/pain' is similar to 'abdominal discomfort over bladder'. The timing of chills is also consistent. [RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'Fever; unusual urine color; unusual urine smell (unsure); vaginal discharge; vaginal itching; leg swelling; ankle swelling; swelling around eyes; fatigue; weakness; recent diet changes; recent fluid intake changes; recent travel; exposure to illness; menstrual cycle changes'. This is significantly different from the GT's 'no pain over transplant site; no back pain; denies fevers; denies nausea; denies vomiting; denies malaise; denies abdominal pain; denies diarrhea'. Only 'Fever' is present in both, and the prediction includes many items not mentioned in the GT. [RESULT]: 1"

    "29001930": {
        "occupation": "[REASON]: The prediction captures the core information that the patient is unemployed, although it omits the reason. [RESULT]: 3",
        "living_situation": "[REASON]: The prediction accurately states that the patient lives alone. [RESULT]: 4",
        "children": "[REASON]: The prediction mentions the baby is in the NICU, which is part of the GT, but omits the detailed obstetric history (G4P0, previous pregnancies). [RESULT]: 2",
        "exercise": "[REASON]: The prediction states 'not much physical activity', which is semantically equivalent to 'Limited physical activity'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "tobacco": "[REASON]: The prediction states 'don't smoke', which is semantically equivalent to 'Denies tobacco use'. [RESULT]: 4",

        "allergies": "[REASON]: The prediction lists the same allergies as the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction states 'No history of similar health issues', which is a reasonable interpretation of 'non-contributory'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction lists most of the medical history items from the GT, including the relevant pregnancy history and recent UTI. It omits the D&C and the cerclage detail. [RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction states 'pain in right side', which is consistent with 'Flank pain' and the location specified in the HPI. [RESULT]: 4",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The prediction provides the exact pain score. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists all the current medications from the GT and also includes the ciprofloxacin taken recently, which is relevant context from the HPI. [RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction captures most of the key positive symptoms and details from the GT, including the location and radiation of pain, fever, vomiting, constipation, headaches, increased frequency, and the context of the prior ED visit and cipro use. It adds some details not explicitly in the GT (lost weight, tired) but these are reasonable inferences from poor intake and illness. It misses the increased pain with breathing. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction lists several negative findings, but none of them are the specific negative findings listed in the GT (CP, burning/urgency with voiding). [RESULT]: 1"
    },
    "23606760": {
        "tobacco": "[REASON]: The prediction 'No smoking' is semantically equivalent to 'Does not use tobacco'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "alcohol": "[REASON]: The prediction captures the type of alcohol and frequency, which is consistent with the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "illicit_drug": "[REASON]: The prediction 'No use' is semantically equivalent to 'Denies illicit drug use'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "sexual_history": "[REASON]: The prediction only lists past STIs, which are part of the medical history in the GT, not the current sexual history details. [RESULT]: 1",
        "allergies": "[REASON]: The prediction 'No allergies' is semantically equivalent to 'No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction accurately lists the family medical history items mentioned in the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction includes the STIs and HTN mentioned in the GT, although it phrases the STIs as 'Urinary tract infections; gonorrhea; chlamydia; syphilis' which is partially correct as STIs can cause UTIs, but the GT specifically lists the STIs. [RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction includes the main chief complaint and adds 'pain with urination', which is a symptom mentioned in the HPI but not explicitly the chief complaint in the GT. [RESULT]: 3",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The prediction provides the same pain score as the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists the exact same medications as the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction captures most of the positive findings listed in the GT, using slightly different phrasing but maintaining the meaning. [RESULT]: 4",

    },
    "28011287": {
        "exercise": "[REASON]: The prediction 'light walking' is a direct match for the GT 'Light walking'. The additional information 'Infrequent' in the GT is not captured in the prediction, but the core exercise type is present. [RESULT]: 3",
        "tobacco": "[REASON]: The prediction 'quit a long time ago' is semantically equivalent to the GT 'Former smoker; Quit many years ago'. Both indicate the patient is a former smoker who quit a significant time ago. [RESULT]: 4",
        "alcohol": "[REASON]: The prediction 'wine sometimes, socially, not very often' captures the key elements of the GT 'Occasional social drinking; Wine; Infrequent'. Both mention wine, social drinking, and infrequency. [RESULT]: 4",
        "illicit_drug": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Not recorded', while the prediction states 'denies use'. These are not consistent. 'Not recorded' means the information wasn't documented, whereas 'denies use' means the patient explicitly stated they don't use illicit drugs. [RESULT]: 1",
        "allergies": "[REASON]: The GT states 'No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions', which is a specific medical statement. The prediction 'denies allergies' is a general statement that is semantically equivalent in this context. [RESULT]: 4",
        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction accurately captures the key family history information from the GT, including premature coronary artery disease in the mother and brother, the mother's angina and leukemia, and the brother's CABG. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medical_device": "[REASON]: The GT lists 'Foley catheter; Continuous bladder irrigation (CBI)'. The prediction only mentions 'catheter (previous hospital visit)'. This is a partial match, missing the CBI and the current status of the device. [RESULT]: 2",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction lists several conditions that are present in the GT's extensive medical history list, including kidney stones, heart attack (MI), CABG surgery, high blood pressure (HTN), high cholesterol (Hyperlipidemia), thyroid problems (Hypothyroid, Enlarged benign thyroid s/p partial thyroidectomy), cataract surgery (Cataract left eye), retinal detachment surgery (Partial retinal detachment s/p surgery), and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). While it doesn't capture every single item, it includes a significant portion of the major conditions. [RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT lists 'Hematuria'. The prediction lists 'blood in urine; lower abdomen pain'. 'Blood in urine' is semantically equivalent to 'Hematuria'. The prediction also includes 'lower abdomen pain', which is mentioned in the present illness positive section of the GT but not as the chief complaint. Therefore, it's a partial match for the chief complaint. [RESULT]: 3",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The GT indicates '0' for pain, suggesting no pain was recorded or present. The prediction indicates '3 (predicted)', suggesting a moderate level of pain was predicted. These are inconsistent. [RESULT]: 1",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'allopurinol; aspirin; metformin; vitamin B12; multivitamin'. The GT lists 'allopurinol, alpha lipoic acid, amiodarone, aspirin [Aspirin Low-Strength], coenzyme Q10 [Co Q-10], levothyroxine, metformin, metoprolol tartrate [Lopressor], multivitamin [Daily Multiple], nitroglycerin, vit B12-FA-pyridoxine-AA no.15'. The prediction includes several medications from the GT (allopurinol, aspirin, metformin, vitamin B12, multivitamin) but misses several others. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The GT lists 'Worsening hematuria; Lower abd pain; Inability to void; Clots; Difficulty voiding'. The prediction lists 'blood in urine (started a few days ago, getting worse, also had blood in urine about a month ago); dull ache in lower abdomen (bothersome when urinating); trouble voiding; clots in urine (sometimes); increased urinary frequency; urinary urgency'. The prediction captures worsening hematuria (blood in urine getting worse), lower abd pain (dull ache in lower abdomen), inability/difficulty voiding (trouble voiding), and clots (clots in urine). It also adds increased urinary frequency and urgency, which are not explicitly in the GT's positive findings but are related symptoms. Overall, it captures the core positive findings. [RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Not recorded'. The prediction lists specific negative findings: 'fever; chills; difficulty swallowing; changes in appetite; weight loss'. Since the GT indicates no negative findings were recorded, the prediction providing specific negative findings is inconsistent. [RESULT]: 1"

        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction 'abdominal pain' is semantically equivalent to 'Abd pain'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The prediction provides a numerical value for pain, but it is different from the GT value. [RESULT]: 3",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists some of the medications but misses several others like amitriptyline, ammonium lactate, aspirin, cholecalciferol, dapsone, docusate sodium, oxycodone, and pravastatin. [RESULT]: 2",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction captures most of the positive symptoms mentioned in the GT, although the phrasing is slightly different. It also includes some additional symptoms not explicitly in the GT like 'feels sick', 'poor appetite', and 'feeling weak'. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction lists some negative symptoms, but they are different from the ones listed in the GT. [RESULT]: 1"
    },
    "27601386": {
        "age": "[REASON]: The prediction provides a general description ('old') instead of the specific age (84) mentioned in the GT. While the patient is old, the exact age is a key demographic detail. [RESULT]: 2",
        "living_situation": "[REASON]: The prediction accurately states that the patient lives with their son, which matches the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "children": "[REASON]: The prediction mentions 'son', which is consistent with the GT stating '1 son'. The number isn't explicitly stated but the presence of a son is correct. [RESULT]: 4",
        "exercise": "[REASON]: The prediction states 'doesn't move around much', which aligns with the GT's description of 'Limited mobility; Occasional short walks'. Both indicate restricted movement. [RESULT]: 4",
        "tobacco": "[REASON]: The prediction states 'denies smoking', which is semantically equivalent to the GT's 'Denies current use' in the context of tobacco. [RESULT]: 4",
        "alcohol": "[REASON]: The prediction mentions 'drinks a little wine sometimes, not often', which is consistent with the GT's 'Occasional social use'. Both indicate infrequent, limited alcohol consumption. [RESULT]: 4",
        "illicit_drug": "[REASON]: The prediction states 'denies use', which is a direct match for the GT's 'Denies illicit drug use'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "allergies": "[REASON]: The prediction correctly identifies 'memantine' as an allergy, matching the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction lists mother stomach cancer, father head injury, and son hemochromatosis, which are all present in the GT. It omits the deceased status and the negative findings (no other cancer or blood disorders), but captures the key positive family history items. [RESULT]: 3",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction lists several conditions (dementia, depression, thyroid cancer, thyroid removed, appendix removed) that are present in the GT. It misses hypothyroidism, obstructive sleep apnea, hypercalcemia, latent tuberculosis, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and includes 'stomach pain (recurrent)' which is a chief complaint/present illness item, not a past medical history diagnosis. [RESULT]: 2",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction states 'stomach pain', which is semantically equivalent to the GT's 'Abd pain' (abdominal pain). [RESULT]: 4",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The prediction states '8', which is the exact pain score provided in the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists acetaminophen, donepezil, levothyroxine, alendronate, calcium, vitamin D, and sertraline. This includes most of the medications listed in the GT (acetaminophen, donepezil, levothyroxine, alendronate, calcium citrate-vitamin D3, cholecalciferol, sertraline). It omits nystatin and groups calcium citrate-vitamin D3 and cholecalciferol as 'calcium' and 'vitamin D'. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction lists lower belly pain, constant pain, burning with urination, and feels hungry, which are all present in the GT (recurrent worsening abdominal pain, constant lower abdominal pain, burning with urination, hungry). It adds 'pain started few days ago' which is not explicitly in the GT's positive findings list but is a common detail in present illness. It misses 'recurrent worsening abdominal pain' and 'two recent admissions for similar abdominal pain' and 'abdominal pain refractory to acetaminophen'. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction lists no changes in bowel habits, no diarrhea, no constipation, no fever, no nausea, no vomiting, no urinary problems before, no recent weight changes, no recent appetite changes (aside from feeling hungry), no recent hydration changes, no increased thirst, no changes in urination amount (except burning), no recent diet changes. The GT lists fever/chills, changes in PO intake, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria, urinary problems, back pain. There is overlap (no diarrhea, no fever, no nausea, no vomiting, no urinary problems) but also significant differences and additions in the prediction. [RESULT]: 2"
