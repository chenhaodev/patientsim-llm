I've been eating less and exercising, so weight loss was expected."}, {"role": "Doctor", "content": "It's good to hear that the weight loss was intentional. One last question: Have you had any recent travel or changes in your diet that might have contributed to your symptoms?"}, {"role": "Patient", "content": "No travel, just normal life.
