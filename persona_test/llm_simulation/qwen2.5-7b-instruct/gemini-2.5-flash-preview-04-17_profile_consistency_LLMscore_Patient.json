The added detail about 'long time ago' is not in the GT but doesn't make the prediction incorrect. [RESULT]: 3",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction 'stomach issue (a while ago)' only captures a very small and vague part of the extensive medical history listed in the GT (Osteoporosis; Mild hyperparathyroidism; Iron deficiency anemia; Hypertension; Hyperlipidemia; Vit D deficiency; GERD; Dementia). 'Stomach issue' could potentially relate to GERD, but it misses all other conditions. [RESULT]: 2",

        "illicit_drug": "[REASON]: The prediction 'No' is semantically equivalent to 'Not reported' in the context of illicit drug use. It indicates no reported history of illicit drug use.\n[RESULT]: 4",
        "allergies": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'Iodine contrast' and 'Doxazosin'. The GT lists 'IV Dye; Iodine Containing Contrast Media; doxazosin'. 'Iodine contrast' and 'Iodine Containing Contrast Media' are semantically equivalent. 'IV Dye' is missing from the prediction, but 'doxazosin' is present (though misspelled in the GT). The prediction captures the main allergies listed in the GT.\n[RESULT]: 3",
        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'Grandfather: liver problems (not alcohol related)', 'Nieces and nephews: cognitive issues', and 'Dad: heart problems'. The GT lists 'Liver disease in grandfather (not alcohol related)', 'multiple nieces and nephews with cognitive issues (without clear diagnosis)', and 'Heart disease'. The prediction accurately captures the key elements from the GT, although it attributes heart disease to 'Dad' which is not specified in the GT.\n[RESULT]: 3",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'Liver transplant; Bypass surgery; Heart issues managed with medication'. The GT lists a detailed history including liver transplant, various bypass surgeries, heart conditions (CAD s/p BMS to LAD; BMS to RCA), and other conditions like CKD, Gout, and SCC. The prediction is a very high-level summary and misses many specific and important details from the GT.\n[RESULT]: 2",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'Tiredness; Chest tightness; Difficulty breathing'. The GT lists 'Difficulty breathing, Dyspnea'. 'Difficulty breathing' is present in both. 'Dyspnea' is a medical term for difficulty breathing. The prediction includes additional symptoms ('Tiredness', 'Chest tightness') that are mentioned in the present illness section of the GT but not explicitly as the chief complaint.\n[RESULT]: 3",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'Amlodipine; Aspirin; Atorvastatin; Carvedilol; Vitamin D; Vitamin B12; Dicloxacillin; Iron; Furosemide; Nitroglycerin; Fish oil; Sulfamethoxazole; Tacrolimus; Valsartan; Zinc'. The GT lists 'amlodipine, aspirin [Adult Low Dose Aspirin], atorvastatin, carvedilol, cholecalciferol (vitamin D3), cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12), dicloxacillin, ferrous sulfate, furosemide, nitroglycerin [Nitrostat], omega-3 fatty acids [Fish Oil Concentrate], sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, tacrolimus, valsartan [Diovan], zinc'. The prediction lists all the medications from the GT, using either the generic name or a common name/description (e.g., Vitamin D for cholecalciferol, Iron for ferrous sulfate, Fish oil for omega-3 fatty acids). The prediction is semantically equivalent.\n[RESULT]: 4",

The GT lists 'Shortness of breath; congestion (onset about days ago); cough productive of clear mucous (onset about days ago); feeling cold (onset about days ago); wheezy breathing (onset after congestion/cough)'. 'Difficulty breathing'/'Shortness of breath', 'Coughing'/'cough', 'Mucus'/'clear mucous', and 'Feeling cold' are present in both. The prediction includes several additional symptoms and details (tiredness, chest tightness, symptom timing, leg/feet swelling, tightness spreading) that are not in the GT's positive findings for present illness.\n[RESULT]: 2",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction lists specific negative findings ('Fever; Chills; Night sweats; Changes in bowel habits; Chest pain radiating to arms, neck, or jaw'). The GT simply states 'Not recorded'. The prediction provides information that is not present in the GT for this key.\n[RESULT]: 1"

        "tobacco": "[REASON]: The GT states 'History of smoking; current status not specified'. The prediction states 'used to smoke, not anymore'. The prediction provides a specific current status (not anymore) which is not explicitly stated in the GT, but it does confirm a history of smoking. It's a slightly more specific interpretation but aligns with the history aspect. [RESULT]: 3",
        "alcohol": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Occasional social drinking; type and amount not specified'. The prediction states 'socially, once a week, a little'. The prediction provides more specific details (once a week, a little) than the GT, but it does align with the 'occasional social drinking' aspect. It's a more detailed interpretation. [RESULT]: 3",

'Sister had a stroke' is semantically equivalent to 'Sister with CVA'. The addition of 'sister has heart problems' is not present in the GT. [RESULT]: 3",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The GT lists multiple conditions: COPD, HLD, breast cancer history, lung cancer history, hysterectomy, osteoporosis. The prediction lists 'COPD; heart disease'. 'COPD' is present in both. 'Heart disease' is a very general term and does not encompass the specific conditions listed in the GT (HLD, cancers, osteoporosis, hysterectomy). It's a significant loss of detail and accuracy. [RESULT]: 2",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT states 'L Arm weakness'. The prediction states 'left hand weakness'. While related, the GT specifies the arm, and the prediction specifies the hand. These are distinct anatomical areas, although hand weakness is a type of arm weakness. [RESULT]: 3",

        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The GT provides a detailed timeline and specific examples of the left hand weakness. The prediction provides a more general statement about left hand weakness since waking and notes improvement and the effect of rest. It captures the core symptom but lacks the specific details and timeline provided in the GT. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The GT lists several denied symptoms including numbness or tingling, previous episodes, recent trauma, cardiac history, vision/hearing changes, dizziness, lightheadedness, and systemic symptoms. The prediction lists no tingling or numbness, no previous episodes, no recent injuries/falls, no changes in vision/speech/balance, no fatigue/unusual symptoms, no recent colds/flu, and light walking doesn't make it worse. There is significant overlap in denied symptoms (tingling/numbness, previous episodes, recent injury/trauma, vision changes). The prediction also includes some denials not explicitly in the GT (speech/balance changes, fatigue, colds/flu, effect of walking) and misses some from the GT (hearing changes, dizziness, lightheadedness, systemic symptoms, cardiac history).

        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The GT lists several specific medical conditions and procedures (UC s/p total proctocolectomy and J pouch, asthma, allergic rhinitis, specific surgeries). The prediction mentions asthma, colon surgery (described in lay terms), and a second surgery for a complication, along with ongoing symptoms. The prediction captures some key elements (asthma, major colon surgery and a complication) but misses others (allergic rhinitis, specific surgical names) and includes ongoing symptoms which are more related to present illness. It's partially correct but lacks the detail and completeness of the GT.\\n[RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT lists \"Abd pain, Nausea\". The prediction lists \"Stomach pain; feeling sick to stomach\". \"Abd pain\" is equivalent to \"Stomach pain\", and \"Nausea\" is equivalent to \"feeling sick to stomach\". The meaning is the same.\\n[RESULT]: 4",
        "pain": "[REASON]: Both the GT and the prediction state the pain level is 7. The prediction is a string, while the GT is an integer, but the value is the same.\\n[RESULT]: 4",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The GT lists specific medications by name (some with brand names). The prediction lists some medications by name (Acetaminophen, Fluticasone, Montelukast) and others by class or purpose (inhaler for asthma, steroids, antacids, probiotic supplement). The prediction captures some of the medications but is less specific and complete than the GT.\\n[RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The GT lists abdominal pain and nausea/vomiting over the past 24 hours. The prediction provides much more detail about the abdominal pain (onset, worsening, character, location, alleviating/aggravating factors) and nausea/vomiting (feeling sick, hard to eat/drink, vomiting a few times today), plus additional positive symptoms like bloating, fullness, increased bowel movements, low appetite, and weight loss. The prediction includes the information from the GT and adds significant detail and other relevant symptoms.\\n[RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The GT lists fever/chills as negative. The prediction lists diarrhea, fever, chills, changes in bowel habits (other than needing to go more often), jaundice, dark urine, recent travel, and exposure to sick people as negative. The prediction includes the negative findings from the GT (fever, chills) and adds several other relevant negative findings. It is more comprehensive but includes the GT information.\\n[RESULT]: 4"

        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction 'Family okay; no heart trouble' captures the essence of 'No heart disease; No sudden cardiac death' but is less specific. [RESULT]: 3",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction 'High blood pressure; heart flutter' only captures a small portion of the extensive medical history listed in the GT. [RESULT]: 2",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT lists 'WEAKNESS'. The prediction lists 'Weak legs; hard to walk; feels hot; fever; confused'. While weakness is included, the prediction adds other symptoms that are part of the present illness positive, not just the chief complaint. [RESULT]: 2",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The GT provides a numerical pain score of 8. The prediction provides a numerical pain score of 5. The values are different. [RESULT]: 1",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'Metoprolol; water pill'. The GT lists multiple medications including 'metoprolol succinate' and 'torsemide' (a water pill). The prediction is incomplete and uses a general term for one medication. [RESULT]: 2",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction 'Weak legs; hard to walk; feels hot; fever; confused; pain in legs; hard to stand up; head feels hot' captures most of the key points from the GT 'Weakness in legs (knees), onset yesterday morning, difficult getting up from toilet, difficulty walking; Fevers, onset yesterday evening; Felt badly; Slightly more confused than usual (per wife)'. It misses the onset details and 'felt badly' but includes the core symptoms. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction 'No other sickness; vision okay; hearing fine' is very general and does not match the specific negative symptoms listed in the GT 'Cough; SOB; Light headedness; Dizziness; Diarrhea; Abdominal pain; Localizing symptoms of infection; CVA tenderness'.

        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction mentions 'High blood pressure' (HTN) and 'Diabetes' (DM2), which are present in the GT. However, it misses 'Prostate cancer s/p resection', 'CAD s/p CABG', and 'Cataracts s/p laser surgery'. It also includes 'Headaches before' and 'Wobbly walking before' which are not explicitly listed in the GT's medical history section but are mentioned in the present illness. The term 'Heart thing' is vague but could refer to CAD s/p CABG. Due to the significant omissions and inclusion of items from the present illness, the consistency is partial. [RESULT]: 2",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT states the chief complaint is 'S/P CVA' (Status Post Cerebrovascular Accident/Stroke). The prediction lists symptoms associated with a potential CVA ('Headache; Hand feels funny; Wobbly walking') but does not explicitly state 'S/P CVA'. While the symptoms are related, they are not the stated chief complaint in the GT. [RESULT]: 2",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The GT explicitly states the pain level is 0. The prediction states the pain level is 3. These values are inconsistent. [RESULT]: 1",

        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction includes 'Headache, started three days ago, pain in front of head, constant' which aligns with 'Bifrontal headache (past 3 days)'. It also includes 'Hand feels funny, left side, numb' which aligns with 'Left face numbness' and 'Left arm numbness'. It includes 'Wobbly walking, started three days ago, not steady' which aligns with 'Walking 'wobbly' (per wife)'. However, it misses 'Tinnitus left ear'. It also includes several negative findings ('No changes in vision; Speech okay; Arms and legs feel normal; Nothing helps much; No falls; Feel normal; No nausea; No vomiting; Appetite normal; Life normal; No big changes; Mood okay; Sleep normal') which belong in the present_illness_negative section. Due to the omission of one positive finding and the inclusion of negative findings, the consistency is partial. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The GT lists numerous negative findings. The prediction lists some negative findings ('Changes in vision; Changes in speech; Changes in strength in arms or legs; Falls; Injuries; More fatigued than usual; Nausea; Vomiting; Changes in appetite; Recent stress; Significant changes in life; Changes in mood; Sleep patterns'). Some of these overlap with the GT (e.g., Changes in vision, Changes in speech, Nausea, Vomiting). However, many negative findings from the GT are missing (e.g., Dizziness, Lightheadedness, Gait instability, Bladder changes, Recent fever, Chills, Night sweats, Recent weight loss or gain, Cough, Shortness of breath, Chest pain or tightness, Palpitations, Diarrhea, Constipation, Abdominal pain, Recent change in bowel or bladder habits, Dysuria, Arthralgias, Myalgias, Rash).

It also includes increased urination frequency and painful urination, which are consistent with UTI symptoms mentioned elsewhere. It misses the details about the medications given (macrobid, cipro) and their lack of effect. [RESULT]: 3",

This is a significant lack of detail compared to the GT. [RESULT]: 1",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The GT lists specific positive findings like agitation, change in behavior/mental status, and imaging findings. The prediction lists symptoms related to cognitive function, appetite, and fatigue.

It misses 'ELEVATED TROP'. It also includes 'can't sleep' which is a positive symptom but not the chief complaint itself. [RESULT]: 3",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The GT provides a numerical value (0), while the prediction provides a predicted numerical value (3). While the format is different, the prediction attempts to quantify pain, but the value is different from the GT. [RESULT]: 2",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists all medications mentioned in the GT: 'Aspirin' (Aspir-81), 'terazosin', 'fish oil' (Fish Oil), and 'multivitamins' (multivitamin). The variations in spelling/capitalization are minor. [RESULT]: 4",

        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction mentions lung cancer surgery and radiation therapy, which are related to the Lung cancer stage IIIA NSCLC mentioned in the GT. However, it misses several other significant medical history items listed in the GT (HTN, CKD, COPD, Pulm Nodule, Brain aneurysm s/p coils, treated hep C, L mastectomy, ovarian cyst). [RESULT]: 2",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT states dyspnea (shortness of breath). The prediction mentions 'shortness of breath' within the present illness positive section, but the chief complaint is described as 'don't feel right since treatments; feels like getting worse'. While related to the overall feeling of being unwell, it doesn't directly capture the primary complaint of dyspnea as stated in the GT. [RESULT]: 2",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists most of the medications from the GT, using either the full name or a common abbreviation/description (e.g., vitamin D for cholecalciferol, fish oil for omega-3-dha-epa-fish oil, vitamin complex for vit B cmplx #9-FA-vit C-vit E). It is missing 'nicotine'. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction includes several symptoms mentioned in the GT (malaise/tired, dizziness/dizzy, fever, productive cough of yellow sputum/cough with yellow stuff coming up, chills).

        "exercise": "[REASON]: The prediction accurately reflects the frequency and type of exercise mentioned in the GT, using slightly different phrasing but conveying the same meaning. 'Twice a week' is semantically equivalent to '2-3 times per week' in this context, and 'daily upper body workouts' is equivalent to 'performs daily upper body exercises'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "tobacco": "[REASON]: The prediction accurately states that the patient denies tobacco use, using the term 'denies smoking' which is semantically equivalent. [RESULT]: 4",
        "alcohol": "[REASON]: The prediction accurately reflects the frequency and amount of alcohol consumption reported in the GT, using slightly different phrasing but conveying the same meaning. 'Socially about once a week, one or two drinks' is semantically equivalent to 'Reports occasional social alcohol use; typically 1-2 drinks per week'. [RESULT]: 4",

        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction includes 'urinary tract infection symptoms', which is the primary chief complaint in the GT. It also adds 'increased spasticity' and 'neck pain', which are listed as positive symptoms in the GT but not explicitly as chief complaints. However, the main chief complaint is present. [RESULT]: 3",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The GT provides a single pain score of 7. The prediction provides pain scores for two different locations (neck and leg spasticity) with different scores. While it mentions pain, it doesn't directly match the single overall pain score provided in the GT. [RESULT]: 2",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists all the medications mentioned in the GT, using the generic names where applicable, which is acceptable. [RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction includes several positive symptoms listed in the GT (fevers, chills, increased spasticity, neck pain, worsening spasms, exacerbation of neck pain). It also adds additional positive symptoms not present in the GT (feeling unwell, neck pain centered around base of skull spreading towards head, increased urinary frequency, painful urination, incomplete bladder emptying, feeling tired, trouble sleeping). While it includes the GT information, it also adds extra details. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The GT lists several negative symptoms. The prediction lists different negative symptoms. There is no overlap in the specific symptoms denied. [RESULT]: 1"

    "21114179": {
        "children": "[REASON]: The prediction states 'grown up' which is a plausible interpretation of 'Has children, number not specified', implying the children are no longer young and dependent. While not an exact match, it conveys a similar idea of having children in the past or present without specifying details. [RESULT]: 3",
        "exercise": "[REASON]: The prediction mentions 'used to dance occasionally' which aligns with 'Occasional dancing'. It also adds 'more sedentary lately', which is not in the GT but doesn't contradict it. [RESULT]: 3",
        "tobacco": "[REASON]: The prediction 'denies smoking' is semantically equivalent to 'No current tobacco use recorded'. [RESULT]: 4",

        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction mentions 'high blood pressure' and 'arthritis', which correspond to 'Hypertension' and 'Rheumatoid Arthritis'. However, it omits 'Prostate cancer s/p prostatectomy' and 'Gastroesophageal reflux disease'. It also incorrectly states 'denies heart problems before this'. [RESULT]: 2",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction 'chest pain' is a simplified version of 'CHEST PAIN (CARDIAC FEATURES)'. While it captures the core complaint, it misses the important detail about cardiac features. [RESULT]: 3",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The GT states '0' which likely indicates no pain score was recorded or the field was left blank. The prediction provides a pain score of '7'. These are completely different. [RESULT]: 1",

        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction captures several key positive symptoms from the GT, including chest pain onset during dancing, constant feeling, bilateral radiation, worse with movement (exertion), sweating (diaphoresis), and shortness of breath (dyspnea). It misses the duration of pain (1 week until ED presentation) and the specific pain score (3.5-4/10). [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The GT explicitly states 'Not recorded'. The prediction provides several negative findings. Therefore, the prediction is inconsistent with the GT. [RESULT]: 1"

The prediction mentions 'Mom had eye problem needing surgery; thyroid thing'. The eye issue is captured, but the denial of cancers and respiratory problems is missed, and a 'thyroid thing' is added which is not in the GT family history. [RESULT]: 2",
        "medical_device": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Not recorded'. The prediction states 'CPAP machine'. This is a significant difference. [RESULT]: 1",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The GT lists several conditions: 'Gum grafts (most recently 9 months ago); Sleep apnea; Obesity; Hypertension; High cholesterol; Prostate nodule; Papillary thyroid cancer; Strep Viridans Bacteremia with Aortic Valve Endocarditis'. The prediction lists 'high blood pressure; heart issues; sleep apnea; prostate nodule; thyroid problems'. Several conditions are captured (hypertension, sleep apnea, prostate nodule, thyroid cancer), but others are missed (gum grafts, obesity, high cholesterol, bacteremia/endocarditis), and 'heart issues' is vague.

The prediction lists 'aspirin; atenolol; hydrochlorothiazide; methimazole; rosuvastatin; sildenafil (sometimes)'. All medications are listed in the prediction, with the addition of '(sometimes)' for sildenafil, which is a minor difference in context but the medication itself is present. [RESULT]: 4",

The prediction lists 'chest pain when walking up hill, started last week, felt like tight band around chest, went away after rest; feeling very tired and sleepy; feeling stressed; feeling less hungry sometimes; feeling lethargic; sometimes wake up gasping for air'. Several key points are captured (pain with exertion, tight band, resolved with rest, started last week, lethargic). Some details are missed (prolonged discomfort, residual dull pain, never had before, malaise), and some are added (stressed, less hungry, gasping for air). [RESULT]: 3",

However, it misses several other significant conditions listed in the GT.\n[RESULT]: 2",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT lists 'Nausea, Pelvic pain'. The prediction lists 'funny feeling down there; tummy hurts'.

However, it misses several other significant medical history items from the GT (A fib, CAD, Diastolic CHF, Beta thalassemia trait). [RESULT]: 2",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT states the chief complaint is 'UNRESPONSIVE'. The prediction states 'right side feels weak'. While right-sided weakness is a symptom related to the unresponsiveness and stroke, it is not the primary chief complaint as stated in the GT. [RESULT]: 2",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists all the medications present in the GT (amlodipine, furosemide, lisinopril, ranitidine, sennosides, Coumadin). It also includes 'vitamins' which is not in the GT. However, the core medications are accurately captured. [RESULT]: 3",

        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'Flomax; naproxen; Simvastatin', which are the same medications listed in the GT 'Flomax, naproxen sodium, Simvastatin'. The slight difference in 'naproxen sodium' vs 'naproxen' is acceptable as they refer to the same drug. [RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction captures several key positive findings from the GT, such as sudden onset chest pain, location (middle of chest/substernal), quality (pressure), association with dyspnea/shortness of breath, improvement over the evening but not resolved, and chronic trouble breathing/ankle swelling.

        "tobacco": "[REASON]: The prediction captures the key information about quitting 20 years ago, which is the most relevant part of the GT. It omits 'Former smoker', but the core information is present and accurate. [RESULT]: 4",
        "alcohol": "[REASON]: The prediction accurately reflects occasional social drinking, stating 'socially, once a month', which is consistent with 'Occasional social drinking; 1-2 drinks per month'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "illicit_drug": "[REASON]: The prediction states 'denies use', which is semantically equivalent to 'None' in the context of illicit drug use. [RESULT]: 4",
        "allergies": "[REASON]: The prediction states 'denies medication or food allergies', which is consistent with 'No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction accurately states 'mom had a stroke', which is consistent with the GT 'Mother: stroke'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction includes 'afib', 'asthma', and 'high blood pressure' (HTN), which are present in the GT. It also includes 'stroke in mom', which is listed under family history in the GT, and 'minor cold a few weeks back', which is not in the GT. While it includes some correct information, it also includes information from another section and irrelevant information. [RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'dizzy; nauseous', which are the main components of the GT 'Dizziness, N/V'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists most of the medications from the GT (alprazolam, amlodipine, finasteride, Flomax, quinapril, sotalol, triamcinolone) and mentions stopping Eliquis for colonoscopy, which is in the present illness positive section of the GT. It is missing apixaban from the medication list. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction includes 'dizzy', 'unsteady', 'sick feeling', and 'nausea', which are related to the GT. However, it misses specific details like sudden onset time, blurry images when standing, feeling tipping both ways, diaphoretic, first episode, and the specific detail about stopping eliquis for colonoscopy (though this is mentioned in the medication section of the prediction). The prediction also includes 'room moving a bit', 'lasted about an hour', and 'felt weak sometimes', which are not in the GT. [RESULT]: 2",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction lists several denied symptoms, some of which are in the GT (headaches, changes in vision which relates to loss of vision, similar episodes in the past which relates to first episode). However, it misses denying veering in one direction, confusion, speech difficulties, dysarthria, and focal weakness or numbness. It also includes denials not present in the GT (hearing issues, changes in appetite, weight changes, recent illnesses, stress, falls or injuries). [RESULT]: 2"

    "24852829": {
        "occupation": "[REASON]: The prediction provides a vague description of the patient's work status ('Busy with work') instead of the specific occupation ('Administrative Assistant') mentioned in the GT. This is a significant difference in the level of detail and accuracy. [RESULT]: 1",
        "exercise": "[REASON]: The prediction mentions walking three times a week, which is consistent with the frequency in the GT. However, it omits the duration of each walk (30 minutes). This is a partial match. [RESULT]: 3",
        "tobacco": "[REASON]: The prediction states 'Don't smoke', which is semantically equivalent to 'Does not use tobacco'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "alcohol": "[REASON]: The prediction states 'Drink socially, one or two times a week', which is semantically equivalent to 'Drinks alcohol socially; 1-2 drinks per week'. [RESULT]: 4",

        "allergies": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'Percocet; aspirin', which is an exact match to the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Not recorded', while the prediction states 'No family history'. These are different statements. 'Not recorded' means the information is unavailable, while 'No family history' means the patient reported no relevant history. [RESULT]: 1",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'UTI; oophorectomy; hysterectomy; c-section', which are all present in the GT's medical history ('URINARY TRACT INFECTION; Laparoscopic oophorectomy; Hysterectomy for fibroids; C-Section'). The prediction also adds 'stomach issues before', which is not in the GT. However, the core medical history items are present and semantically equivalent (e.g., UTI for URINARY TRACT INFECTION). [RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Abd pain', while the prediction states 'Tummy hurts bad'. Both indicate abdominal pain, but the prediction uses less formal language and adds an intensity descriptor ('bad') not explicitly in the GT's chief complaint (though pain intensity is captured elsewhere). It's semantically similar but not an exact or perfectly equivalent medical term. [RESULT]: 3",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The prediction states '10', which is an exact match to the numerical pain score in the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'Lisinopril', which is in the GT. It also adds 'over-the-counter stuff (tried, didn't help)', which is not in the GT. The core medication is present, but additional information is included. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction includes many of the positive symptoms from the GT, such as nausea, vomiting, worsening pain, cramping, lack of BM, attempted enema with small stool, and pain duration/worsening. It also includes 'Tummy pain all around' (diffuse abdominal pain) and 'urine dark, like tea' (consistent with hematuria). It omits 'tolerating minimal po' and 'recent ED visit for dysuria, resolved'. It adds 'eating makes pain worse' and 'bloating'. Overall, a significant portion of the GT's positive findings are captured, with some omissions and additions. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The GT lists 'fevers; chills; chest pain; SOB'. The prediction lists 'No fever; no changes to diet or routine; no stress; no weight loss; appetite normal; no recent travel; no exposure to anyone who was ill; no difficulty swallowing; no pain while swallowing'. Only 'No fever' is present in both (semantically equivalent to 'fevers' being negative). The other negative findings are completely different. [RESULT]: 2"

        "allergies": "[REASON]: The prediction mentions an allergy related to kidney medicine causing rashes, which is not specific to cinacalcet. [RESULT]: 2",
        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction accurately captures the key points from the GT regarding the father and siblings. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction mentions kidney transplant, which is correct, but misses other significant history like ESRD, HD, PD, Hypertension, and Chronic pancytopenia. It also adds UTIs which are not in the GT. [RESULT]: 2",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction includes kidney pain and fever, which are present in the GT (L Flank pain, Fever), but misses Dysuria. [RESULT]: 3",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The GT provides a pain score of 4, while the prediction provides a predicted score of 7. These are different values. [RESULT]: 1",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction provides a very general summary of the medications, not listing specific drugs or classes mentioned in the GT. [RESULT]: 2",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction captures most of the positive symptoms mentioned in the GT, including pain in the kidney area, fever, burning with urination, cloudy urine, and pus around the tube site. [RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'no chills; no shaking' which are not explicitly mentioned in the GT's negative findings. The GT states 'no other discomfort or problems', which is a broader statement. [RESULT]: 1"

        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction accurately captures all the conditions listed in the GT, using slightly different phrasing but maintaining the same meaning. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction includes most of the conditions from the GT, although it simplifies some of the descriptions (e.g., 'aorta big' for 'Dilated ascending aorta 3.6 cm; sinus aorta 4.1 cm', 'past UTI' which is not explicitly in the GT but could be inferred from the kidney stone/hydro/procedures). It misses the specific procedures mentioned in the GT. [RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'Fever; shortness of breath; pain'. The GT lists 'Fever, Dyspnea, Dysuria'. 'Dyspnea' is shortness of breath, and 'Dysuria' is burning with urination, which is a type of pain. The prediction captures the core complaints. [RESULT]: 4",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The prediction provides the same numerical value as the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists all the medications mentioned in the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction captures several key positive symptoms from the GT (fever, shortness of breath, burning with urination/pain, chest pain, fatigue). However, it misses several others like right flank pain, black stools, emesis with blood, malaise, hematuria, bruising/bleeding. It also includes some details not explicitly in the GT like 'sometimes back, worse with deep breaths, better lying down' for chest pain and 'more often to pee; dark yellow urine, sometimes pinkish'. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction lists different negative findings than the GT. The GT focuses on things like recent surgery, immobilization, leg issues, hormone use, and active cancer, which are relevant to potential DVT or other systemic issues. The prediction lists recent illnesses/infections, travel, exposure, and appetite/weight changes. While these are valid negative findings, they are not the ones specified in the GT. [RESULT]: 1"

        "alcohol": "[REASON]: The prediction 'drinks sometimes, not much' is a vague description of alcohol use, while the GT provides more specific details ('socially, occasionally, 1-2 drinks per occasion'). The prediction is partially correct but lacks detail.\n[RESULT]: 3",
        "illicit_drug": "[REASON]: The prediction 'denies drug use' is semantically equivalent to the GT 'Denies illicit drug use.'. Both indicate no illicit drug use.\n[RESULT]: 4",

        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction provides a very limited and vague summary of the patient's complex medical history listed in the GT. It mentions 'bladder surgery' which relates to the ileal conduit, and 'ulcer' which relates to the chronic posterior ulcer, but misses many other significant conditions.\n[RESULT]: 2",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT states 'R Flank pain' as the chief complaint, while the prediction states 'back pain'. While flank pain is a type of back pain, 'flank' is more specific and accurate in this context. The prediction is partially correct but less precise.\n[RESULT]: 3",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The prediction provides the exact same pain score as the GT.\n[RESULT]: 4",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists all four medications mentioned in the GT. It also adds the detail about oxycodone not providing relief, which is present in the 'present_illness_positive' section of the GT, making it a good inclusion here.\n[RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction captures several key positive symptoms from the GT (back pain radiating to groin, nausea, left leg red and swollen, chills/feeling cold). However, it misses the details about cloudy and malodorous urine, and the specific description of the chronic posterior ulcer (enlarged, draining yellow fluid). It also includes 'leg feels warm and swollen' which is redundant with 'left leg red and swollen'.\n[RESULT]: 3",
