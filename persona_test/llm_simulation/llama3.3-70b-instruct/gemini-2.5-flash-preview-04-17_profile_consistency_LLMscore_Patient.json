The prediction only mentions 'heart problem (unspecified type)' and 'chronic illness (unspecified type)'. This is a significant loss of specific medical information. [RESULT]: 2",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Chest pain'. The prediction states 'chest pain yesterday'. The prediction adds a temporal detail ('yesterday') which is present in the present illness section of the GT, but the chief complaint itself in the GT is simply 'Chest pain'. However, given the context of the present illness, 'chest pain yesterday' is a reasonable interpretation of the chief complaint. [RESULT]: 3",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The GT indicates the presence of pain with a value of 1 (likely representing a binary presence). The prediction provides a pain score range (4-5).

        "living_situation": "[REASON]: The prediction specifies 'Lives with daughter' while the GT states 'Lives with family'. While living with a daughter is a type of living with family, it's a more specific detail not present in the GT. However, it's a plausible interpretation based on the mention of the daughter in other parts of the profile. [RESULT]: 3",
        "children": "[REASON]: The prediction states 'One daughter' which is consistent with the GT 'Has children; at least one daughter'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "tobacco": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Tobacco abuse'. The prediction states 'Smoked for a long time; trying to quit'. This indicates a history of tobacco use, which aligns with 'Tobacco abuse', although the prediction adds detail about trying to quit which is not in the GT. [RESULT]: 3",
        "alcohol": "[REASON]: Both the GT and prediction state 'Denies alcohol use'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "allergies": "[REASON]: Both the GT and prediction list 'Sulfa' and 'Bacitracin'. The GT specifies 'Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics)' but the prediction's 'Sulfa' is semantically equivalent in this context. [RESULT]: 4",
        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Mother died of MI'. The prediction states 'Mother had heart attack (died)'. 'MI' is a medical abbreviation for Myocardial Infarction, which is a heart attack. The prediction is semantically equivalent. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medical_device": "[REASON]: The GT lists '2L supplemental oxygen only at night; Cane (occasional use); Walker'. The prediction lists 'Oxygen (at night); walker'. The prediction misses the cane and the specific oxygen flow rate but captures the main devices mentioned. [RESULT]: 3",

The prediction lists 'Albuterol; aspirin; calcium; vitamin D; Spiriva; Advair; prednisone'. The prediction captures several medications but misses many others (hydrocortisone, Mucinex, amlodipine, bupropion, citalopram, hydrochlorothiazide) and uses brand names/general terms for some (Advair, calcium, vitamin D, Spiriva) which is acceptable.

The prediction lists 'Chest pain; vomiting (yesterday or day before); head spinning; tired; weak; confused; hard to breathe; coughing (wet sound); shaky; wakes up 2-3 times at night to use bathroom; legs swell; feet swell'. The prediction captures some key symptoms (vomiting, weak, confused, hard to breathe/SOB, coughing with wet sound, shaky, waking up to urinate, leg/feet swell) but misses the timeline details, being in bed all day, able to eat, and the daughter's observations about the cough.

The prediction lists 'Sharp chest pain; dull chest pain; shortness of breath (explicitly denied, but later states 'hard to breathe'); sweating; fever; chills; weight change'. The prediction explicitly denies fever and weight change (related to weight loss), which aligns with the GT. However, it explicitly denies chest pain but then lists it as a positive finding elsewhere, and includes denials for sweating and chills which are not in the GT. It also has a contradictory statement about shortness of breath. [RESULT]: 2"

However, it also includes symptoms not in the GT such as 'back hurt', 'sharp pain like knife', 'diarrhea' (though diarrhea was part of the flu-like illness, it's listed separately), 'no eat', 'lose weight', 'vomit few weeks ago', 'stomach hurt few weeks ago', 'worry', 'scared', and 'drink water'. It also misses the context of symptoms returning after stopping nitrofurantoin and persistence despite antibiotics. [RESULT]: 3",

The GT lists 'Unintentional weight loss over last year (50lb loss); chronic cough; small amount of yellow sputum over past several days; constipation thought to be partially causing decreased appetite'. The prediction captures the core positive findings from the GT and adds some related symptoms (poor appetite, swallowing issue, weakness, tiredness, leg swelling) which may or may not be directly stated as positive findings in the source text but are plausible related symptoms. It is mostly consistent with the key points. [RESULT]: 3",

        "tobacco": "[REASON]: The prediction 'No smoke' is semantically equivalent to 'Does not use tobacco'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "alcohol": "[REASON]: The prediction 'Little alcohol' is a vague description compared to the GT 'Drinks alcohol socially; 1-2 drinks per week'. It is partially correct but lacks specificity. [RESULT]: 3",
        "illicit_drug": "[REASON]: The prediction 'No drugs' is semantically equivalent to 'Denies illicit drug use'. [RESULT]: 4",

        "medical_device": "[REASON]: The prediction mentions 'Colostomy bag', which is not listed in the GT. The GT lists 'wheelchair; VP shunt; Ileal conduit'. The ileal conduit is a type of urinary diversion, which might be confused with a colostomy bag by a layperson, but they are distinct medical devices. [RESULT]: 1",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction 'Bad back (born with); stomach problem' is a very simplified and partially correct representation of the GT's detailed medical history including Spina bifida, wheelchair-bound, Ileal conduit, recurrent UTI, etc. 'Bad back (born with)' relates to Spina bifida, and 'stomach problem' is too vague to match any specific item in the GT. [RESULT]: 2",

        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction includes 'Trouble breathe' and 'Pain chest', which are related to the GT's 'WEAKNESS/SOB' and the positive present illness findings of dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain, but it doesn't explicitly state 'WEAKNESS/SOB'. [RESULT]: 3",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The GT indicates no pain (0), while the prediction provides a pain score of 7. These are contradictory. [RESULT]: 1",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction only lists two medications (Lantus, Lasix) out of the many listed in the GT. [RESULT]: 2",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction includes several symptoms related to the GT's positive findings (Trouble breathe, Weak, Tired, Pain chest, Hurt when breathe, Sharp chest pain, Hurt more breathe) but also includes additional symptoms not explicitly listed in the GT (Legs swell, Belly big, No eat, Fast breathe, Breathe hard). It misses 'recently diagnosed pneumonia'. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction includes several of the negative findings listed in the GT (No fever, No chill, No nausea, No vomit) but misses others (diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, leg pain, other symptoms). [RESULT]: 3"

        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction only lists a few items from the extensive medical history provided in the ground truth. It misses many significant conditions and procedures. [RESULT]: 2",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction includes 'Body aches' and 'Shaking', which are related to the GT's 'Body aches' and the shaking chills mentioned in the HPI. 'Headache' is missing, and 'Feeling cold' is added. It captures some but not all of the chief complaint and includes related symptoms. [RESULT]: 3",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists some of the medications but misses several others and includes a general category ('Bowel medication') instead of specific names. [RESULT]: 2",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction includes several positive symptoms mentioned in the GT (shaking, chills, itchy skin, frequent urination, body aches, feeling lousy). It also includes some symptoms not explicitly listed in the GT but potentially related (feeling cold, loss of appetite, feeling weak, sleep little, back pain). It misses some details from the GT (dysuria timing, achiness attribution/worsening, abdominal pain). [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction lists several negative symptoms that are also present in the ground truth (fever, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting).

    "27521106": {
        "marital_status": "[REASON]: The prediction accurately reflects the patient's marital status as married, which is consistent with the GT. Slight difference in capitalization is negligible. [RESULT]: 4",
        "living_situation": "[REASON]: The prediction states 'Lives with wife', which is semantically equivalent to the GT 'Lives with spouse'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "exercise": "[REASON]: The prediction 'Rests a lot' is a plausible consequence of 'Limited activity due to health status' but doesn't directly state the reason for limited activity. It's partially correct. [RESULT]: 3",
        "tobacco": "[REASON]: The prediction 'No smoking' is semantically equivalent to the GT 'No current use' in the context of tobacco. [RESULT]: 4",
        "alcohol": "[REASON]: The prediction 'No drinking' is semantically equivalent to the GT 'No current use' in the context of alcohol. [RESULT]: 4",
        "allergies": "[REASON]: The prediction 'No allergies' is a concise and accurate representation of the GT 'No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction captures the key elements of the family history: brother with hemochromatosis and father/brothers with sudden cardiac death (heart problems). It omits the negative history of lung disease/pulmonary hypertension, but the positive findings are well-represented. [RESULT]: 3",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction lists several key medical history items (heart failure, cirrhosis, kidney dysfunction, thyroid condition, LVP, belly issues treated with lactulose/rifaximin). While it doesn't list every single condition from the GT, it captures the major and most relevant ones mentioned in the GT. [RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT lists 'Tachycardia'. The prediction lists 'Fast heartbeat; tiredness'. 'Fast heartbeat' is a direct synonym for tachycardia. 'Tiredness' is an additional symptom not listed as the chief complaint in the GT. [RESULT]: 3",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The GT states '0'. The prediction states '0 (predicted)'. The value is the same. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists some of the medications from the GT (Aspirin, bumetanide, lactulose, rifaximin, thyroid medicine) and mentions 'many others'. It doesn't list all medications but captures several key ones and indicates there are more. [RESULT]: 3",
        "arrival_transport": "[REASON]: The GT states 'AMBULANCE'. The prediction states 'Came with wife'. These are completely different and inconsistent. [RESULT]: 1",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The GT lists increased abdominal distension, increased bilateral lower extremity edema, 3-pound weight gain, and wife's concern about salty foods. The prediction lists fast heartbeat, tiredness, swollen legs, big belly, 3-pound weight gain, and uncomfortable. There is overlap (swollen legs/edema, big belly/abdominal distension, 3-pound weight gain), but the prediction also includes symptoms not in the GT's positive list (fast heartbeat, tiredness, uncomfortable) and misses the wife's concern. [RESULT]: 2",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Not recorded'. The prediction provides a list of negative symptoms. These are inconsistent. [RESULT]: 1"

        "occupation": "[REASON]: The prediction 'no work' is a semantically equivalent way of stating 'Retired'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "exercise": "[REASON]: The prediction 'walk little' is a simplified but semantically similar description of 'Limited activity due to medical conditions; Occasional short walks'. [RESULT]: 3",
        "medical_device": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'pacemaker; AICD', which are both present in the GT ('AICD; pacer dependent'). The prediction accurately captures the key medical devices. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'heart problem; afib; seizure (today, first time)'. The GT is much more comprehensive, listing numerous conditions including CHF, HTN, CVA, carotid stenosis, dyslipidemia, arthritis, bladder cancer, visual impairment, hard of hearing, CABG x 3, AAA repair, AICD implant, bladder tumor excision with BCG therapy, afib ablation, and L CEA. The prediction only captures a small subset of the GT's medical history. [RESULT]: 2",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Seizure'. The prediction lists 'legs weak; shake all over; confused'. While these symptoms are related to the event, they are not the primary chief complaint as stated in the GT. [RESULT]: 1",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The prediction correctly identifies the pain level as 0, matching the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'aspirin; digoxin; warfarin; lisinopril; furosemide'. The GT lists a more extensive list: 'aspirin [Adult Low Dose Aspirin], digoxin, docusate sodium, finasteride, furosemide, lisinopril, metoprolol succinate, oxycodone, pravastatin, tamsulosin [Flomax], warfarin [Coumadin]'. The prediction only includes a subset of the medications listed in the GT. [RESULT]: 2",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'legs weak (today); shake all over (today); confused (today); no see good (today)'. The GT lists 'bilateral leg weakness (woke up feeling weak); tremors (\"a fit of shaking\"; all over tremors); witnessed GTC (today; lasting 2 minutes in ambulance); right sided weakness (?Todds) (after GTC in ambulance); mildly confused (on arrival); some perseveration (on arrival); INR subtherapeutic at 1.6 (at OSH)'. The prediction captures some of the key positive findings but misses important details like the witnessed GTC, right-sided weakness, perseveration, and the INR value. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Not recorded'. The prediction provides a list of negative findings. Since the GT explicitly states that negative findings were not recorded, the prediction is inconsistent with the GT. [RESULT]: 1"
