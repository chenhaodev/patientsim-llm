While partially correct, it lacks completeness and accuracy regarding the status of the son. [RESULT]: 3",
        "exercise": "[REASON]: The GT describes 'Limited mobility; occasional short walks'. The prediction states 'rarely go out; stay home most of the time'. Both indicate limited physical activity, although the prediction is less specific about the type of activity. The meaning is semantically similar. [RESULT]: 4",
        "tobacco": "[REASON]: The GT states 'No current tobacco use; history not fully documented'. The prediction says 'denies smoking'. Both indicate no current use. The prediction is a common way to express this in a clinical context and is semantically equivalent to the 'No current tobacco use' part of the GT. [RESULT]: 4",

        "allergies": "[REASON]: The GT lists 'atorvastatin'. The prediction lists 'atorvastatin (makes me feel really bad)'. The core allergen, atorvastatin, is present in both. The additional detail in the prediction about the reaction is relevant clinical information often included with allergies. The prediction contains the exact GT value plus additional context.

        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The GT lists specific conditions and relationships (Sister: CAD (died); Sister: CAD; Four siblings: diabetes mellitus; Son: lung ca (died); Daughter: lung ca; Sister: breast ca). The prediction lists 'sisters had heart disease; four siblings had diabetes; son had lung cancer; daughter had lung cancer'. The prediction captures the key conditions and relationships mentioned in the GT, although it simplifies the details (e.g., 'heart disease' instead of 'CAD', missing the deceased status of one sister and the breast cancer). It is largely correct but lacks some specificity. [RESULT]: 3",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The GT lists many conditions (Sickle Cell Trait; Alpha Thalassemia Trait; Iron-deficiency anemia; Pulmonary lung nodule (stable, never biopsied); Chronic Abdominal pain; HTN; HLD; CKD; T2DM; Diabetes mellitus; Arthritis; Dementia). The prediction lists 'high blood pressure; diabetes; chronic abdominal pain; arthritis'. The prediction only includes a subset of the conditions listed in the GT. It misses several significant diagnoses. [RESULT]: 2",

The prediction lists 'sudden onset sharp chest pain; pain radiates to left arm; pain lasted about an hour; pain got better on its own; felt nauseous; vomited; feeling dizzy; feeling weak; feeling tired; lost a little weight; feeling worried; feeling sad sometimes'. The prediction includes several key points from the GT (pain radiates to left arm, lasted about an hour, got better on its own, felt nauseous, vomited). However, it adds several symptoms not mentioned in the GT (sudden onset sharp, dizzy, weak, tired, lost weight, worried, sad) and misses others (L sided, resolved in ED, hypertension improved). It is a mix of correct and incorrect/added information. [RESULT]: 2",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The GT lists specific negative findings (dyspnea; palpitations; anaphylaxis).

        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists the same medications as the GT, using slightly different phrasing for the vitamins. [RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction captures several key positive findings from the GT (abdominal pain left side, bloating/abdominal distension, small bowel movement this morning, no gas/last flatus yesterday, nausea this morning, low appetite, less frequent bowel movements). It misses 'increasing abdominal distension overnight' and 'persistent left-sided abdominal pain since surgery'. It also includes 'dull ache pain' and 'smaller and more formed bowel movements' which are not explicitly in the GT but are related to the described symptoms. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The GT lists 'fever; chills; bloody stools; dysuria'. The prediction lists 'no change in pain/bloating with actions; no vomiting; no fever; no changes in diet; no weight loss; no recent infections'.

        "exercise": "[REASON]: The GT describes exercise as 'Limited to activities of daily living; Assisted mobility'. The prediction states 'walk with assistance'. While 'walk with assistance' is a form of assisted mobility, the GT provides a broader description including other activities of daily living. The prediction is partially correct but less comprehensive. [RESULT]: 3",
        "tobacco": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Former smoker; Quit many years ago'. The prediction states 'quit many years ago'. The prediction captures the key information about quitting many years ago, which is the most relevant part of the GT regarding current status. [RESULT]: 4",

The prediction includes loss of appetite (2 days), decreased fluid intake (2 days), cough (2 days), worsening speech (2 days), and difficulty swallowing (2 days). It also adds other symptoms not in the GT (sore throat, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, shortness of breath, chest pain, increased confusion, difficulty with daily activities). While it captures the core symptoms from the GT with the correct duration, it includes additional information not present in the GT. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Not recorded'. The prediction lists specific negative findings (fever, chills, leg swelling).

It also includes 'fever (100.4°F)' and 'headache', which are not explicitly in the GT's positive symptoms. The GT mentions 'subjective fever (noted by wife)', so the fever is related but the specific temperature is not in the GT. Headache is not in the GT. [RESULT]: 3",

        "alcohol": "[REASON]: The GT states a history of alcohol abuse with current status not specified. The prediction mentions a history of use and trying to cut back. This is partially consistent as it acknowledges past use, but the 'trying to cut back' is a detail not in the GT and doesn't fully capture the 'abuse' aspect.\n[RESULT]: 3",
        "illicit_drug": "[REASON]: The GT mentions a history of polysubstance abuse including cocaine, with current status not specified.

However, it misses the back pain and joint pain details from the GT.\n[RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The GT lists specific denied symptoms like stomach pain, acid reflux, trauma, cough, fevers, and nasal congestion.

It is partially correct but incomplete. [RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT lists 'Visual changes'. The prediction lists 'unwell; vision blurry; unsteady'.

        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction includes several of the positive symptoms listed in the GT (unwell, vision blurry, unsteady, disoriented, lightheaded). However, it omits 'acute onset feeling unwell', 'unbalanced', 'feeling like going to fall over', and 'images blurred or out of focus'. It also adds 'tired lately' which is not in the GT. It is partially correct but incomplete and includes an extra item. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The GT lists 'no known hypertension' and 'never fell'. The prediction includes 'No high blood pressure' (semantically equivalent to no known hypertension) and 'Never fallen'. It also adds several other negative findings not present in the GT.

        "allergies": "[REASON]: The prediction 'cinacalcet' is an exact match to the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction 'father died young (cause unknown); siblings healthy' captures the key information from the GT 'Father died when young; several siblings healthy'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medical_device": "[REASON]: The prediction 'nephrostomy tube (capped 1 week ago)' captures the main device and its status, which is the most relevant part of the GT 'nephrostomy tube placement; tube capped 1 week ago; nephrostomy tube in place'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction 'kidney transplant (few years ago); nephrostomy tube (capped 1 week ago); hospital visits' only captures the renal transplant and the nephrostomy tube information from the GT. It misses ESRD from HTN, history of HD, history of PD, Hypertension, and Chronic pancytopenia. [RESULT]: 2",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction includes the chief complaints from the GT (burning with urination, cloudy urine, fever, pain over transplant site, pus around nephrostomy tube site) but also adds redness and swelling around the nephrostomy tube site, which are symptoms rather than the core chief complaints listed in the GT. However, the core complaints are present. [RESULT]: 3",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists only three medications (atovaquone, carvedilol, prednisone) out of the nine listed in the GT. [RESULT]: 2",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction includes all the positive symptoms listed in the GT and adds redness, swelling, and increased pain around the nephrostomy tube site, which are related but not explicitly in the GT. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction lists different negative symptoms than the GT. The GT states 'no other discomfort or problems', while the prediction lists 'denies changes in urine output; denies issues with nephrostomy tube prior to burning sensation'. [RESULT]: 1"
    },
    "23330607": {
        "occupation": "[REASON]: The prediction 'Working' is a very general term and does not specify the type of work, unlike the GT 'Administrative Assistant'. It's partially correct in that the person is employed, but lacks the specific detail. [RESULT]: 2",
        "living_situation": "[REASON]: The prediction 'Staying home' is not equivalent to 'Lives alone'. 'Staying home' describes a current activity, while 'Lives alone' describes the living arrangement. [RESULT]: 1",
        "tobacco": "[REASON]: 'Never smoke' is semantically equivalent to 'Never used tobacco'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "alcohol": "[REASON]: 'Rarely, once a month' is a more specific description of 'Rarely drinks alcohol'. It is consistent with the GT. [RESULT]: 4",

        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction only includes 'Asthma' and 'high blood pressure', missing several other significant medical conditions listed in the GT (Vit D deficiency, Hyperlipidemia, Dilated ascending aorta, sinus aorta, L kidney stone, L hydro, s/p ureteroscopy with laser lithotripsy, s/p retrograde pyelogram, s/p Left ureteral stent placement). [RESULT]: 2",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction includes all the chief complaints listed in the GT (Fever, Dyspnea/hard to breathe, Dysuria/pain when urinating) and adds 'chest pain', which is also mentioned as a positive symptom in the GT. It is consistent with the GT and provides additional relevant information. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists several medications from the GT but misses 'Calcium 600 + D(3)' and 'ibuprofen'. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction includes many of the positive symptoms listed in the GT, such as fever, shortness of breath (hard to breathe), dysuria (pain when urinating), chest pain, fatigue (very tired), weakness (feel weak), and hematuria (urine dark, sometimes red). However, it misses several others like right flank pain, black stools, emesis with blood streaks, malaise, intermittent easy bruising and bleeding. It also includes some symptoms not explicitly listed in the GT's positive section but potentially related (chills, weight loss, cough, wheezing, low appetite, hard to eat). [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction includes 'No recent sickness or surgery' and 'no swelling in legs or feet', which are partially consistent with 'recent surgery', 'immobilization', and 'leg swelling' in the GT. However, it misses 'leg pain', 'hormone use', and 'active cancer'. It also includes 'no recent travel' and 'haven't been around sick people' which are not in the GT. [RESULT]: 2"

        "alcohol": "[REASON]: The prediction mentions drinking 'sometimes' and '1-2 drinks', which aligns with the GT's description of social, occasional drinking of 1-2 drinks per occasion.[RESULT]: 4",

        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction accurately captures the family history for mother (heart problems, heart attack, heart failure), father (cancer), and sister (kidney stones), using slightly different but semantically equivalent terms.[RESULT]: 4",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction only captures 'high blood pressure' and vaguely mentions 'surgeries' and 'urinary tract issues'. It misses many specific and important medical history items listed in the GT, such as spina bifida, wheelchair-bound, ileal conduit, VP shunt, cellulitis, and DVT's.[RESULT]: 2",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction 'right side pain' is a reasonable interpretation of 'R Flank pain', as flank pain is located on the side.[RESULT]: 4",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The GT provides a specific pain score of 10, while the prediction provides a different score of 8. Although it provides a number for pain, it is not the same as the GT.[RESULT]: 1",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists atenolol, lisinopril, and oxycodone, which are present in the GT. It also mentions 'something for bladder', which likely refers to methenamine hippurate, but it is not explicitly named. The note about oxycodone being taken without relief is also present in the present illness section of the GT.[RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction captures many positive symptoms from the GT, including increased right flank pain, worsening pain, onset 10 days ago, acute worsening yesterday, pain radiating to groin, nausea, chills, cloudy urine, and malodorous urine. It misses the details about the left leg being red and swollen, and the chronic posterior ulcer details. It also includes 'sharp pain', 'burning pain', and 'tired sometimes' which are not explicitly in the GT.[RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction includes 'no vomiting' and 'no fever', which are present in the GT (fevers denied). It misses 'dyruria denied' and 'hematuria denied'. It also includes several negative findings not present in the GT, such as 'no trigger for pain', 'nothing helps pain', 'sitting makes pain worse', 'no weight loss', 'appetite okay', 'no changes in bowel habits', and 'no recent travel'.[RESULT]: 2"

        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction is semantically equivalent to the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The GT states no pain (0), while the prediction states a pain score of 2. These are inconsistent. [RESULT]: 1",

        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction includes some of the positive symptoms from the GT (dyspnea/hard to breathe, fatigue/tired, pleuritic chest pain/hurts when breathing deep) but also includes additional symptoms not in the GT. It misses the recently diagnosed pneumonia. [RESULT]: 3",

        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction lists some of the major medical history items (heart disease, high cholesterol, lung cancer, bladder cancer) but misses several others (INSOMNIA, Peripheral vascular disease details, DIVERTICULITIS, cysts, IBD, cholecystectomy, atrial fibrillation). 'Bladder problems a few weeks ago' is a very vague reference to the bladder carcinoma history. [RESULT]: 2",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT lists 'Body aches, Headache', while the prediction lists 'whole body hurts'. 'Whole body hurts' is semantically similar to 'Body aches' but misses the headache. [RESULT]: 3",
