    "22590895": {
        "living_situation": "[REASON]: The prediction accurately identifies homelessness as the living situation, using a semantically equivalent term ('Homeless'). It also adds 'Unstable', which is consistent with homelessness. [RESULT]: 4",
        "tobacco": "[REASON]: The prediction mentions cigarettes and that the amount is not specified, which aligns with the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "alcohol": "[REASON]: The prediction states 'Heavy drinker; amount not specified'. While 'Heavy drinker' is related to alcoholism, it doesn't fully capture the severity indicated by 'Alcoholism; found down intoxicated; alcohol intoxication' in the GT. [RESULT]: 3",
        "illicit_drug": "[REASON]: The prediction states 'Denies use', which is semantically equivalent to 'No reported illicit drug use'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "allergies": "[REASON]: The prediction states 'Denies known allergies', which is semantically equivalent to 'No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction states 'Denies major health issues'. The GT specifically mentions 'No family history of respiratory issues'. The prediction is a more general denial and doesn't specifically address respiratory issues. [RESULT]: 2",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'Alcoholism; severe alcohol withdrawal with seizures; high blood pressure; arthritis; osteoporosis; possible optic neuritis'. This aligns well with the GT's list of conditions, including the detail about severe withdrawal syndrome (seizures and DTs). [RESULT]: 4",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT lists 'ETOH, ILI'. The prediction lists 'Persistent cough and cold; upper belly pain; anxiety about symptoms'. While the prediction includes symptoms related to ILI (cough and cold) and potentially related to ETOH (upper belly pain, anxiety), it doesn't explicitly mention ETOH as a chief complaint or the 'found down intoxicated' aspect which is a key part of the GT's chief complaint context. [RESULT]: 2",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The GT states the pain score is 0. The prediction also states '0'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'Lisinopril; carvedilol; unsure of others'. This includes the medications listed in the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The GT lists 'found down intoxicated; complained of cough and cold symptoms x2 weeks; quite tachycardic on presentation; upper belly hurts'. The prediction lists 'Persistent cough; cold; upper belly pain; sharp, stabbing upper belly pain radiating to back; loss of appetite; weight loss; mild nausea; low-grade fever; chills, especially at night; stress from living situation; anxiety about health; trouble sleeping'. The prediction includes cough, cold, and upper belly pain, which are in the GT. However, it misses 'found down intoxicated' and 'quite tachycardic on presentation' and adds several other symptoms not present in the GT. [RESULT]: 2",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Not recorded'. The prediction lists several denied symptoms. Since the GT explicitly states it's not recorded, any prediction listing specific negative findings is inconsistent. [RESULT]: 1"

    "29114252": {
        "exercise": "[REASON]: The prediction accurately reflects the patient's exercise habits, using slightly different phrasing but conveying the same meaning. 'Few times a week' is semantically equivalent to '3x/week' in this context. [RESULT]: 4",
        "tobacco": "[REASON]: The prediction states 'no smoking' which is semantically equivalent to 'Non-smoker'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "alcohol": "[REASON]: The prediction captures the specific detail of wine consumption (1-2 glasses/week) but omits the 'Occasional social drinking' aspect. [RESULT]: 3",
        "illicit_drug": "[REASON]: The prediction states 'no recreational drugs' which is semantically equivalent to 'No known illicit drug use'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "allergies": "[REASON]: The prediction correctly identifies the allergy as Doxycycline. [RESULT]: 4",
        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction includes the 'no history of stroke' information and adds other family history details not present in the GT. The consistency is high for the specific item mentioned in the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction includes the branch retinal vein occlusion and presumed DVT, which are present in the GT. However, it omits the breast cancer history and the detail about warfarin discontinuation related to the DVT. [RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction states 'sudden double vision' which is a more specific description of the 'Visual changes' mentioned in the GT, but accurately reflects the core issue. [RESULT]: 4",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The prediction correctly states the pain level as 0. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists all the medications mentioned in the GT and also includes warfarin (discontinued), which is relevant context from the medical history. The consistency is high for the listed medications. [RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction accurately captures the key positive symptoms: sudden onset horizontal double vision, resolution with eye closure, and constancy since waking. The phrasing is slightly different but the meaning is the same. [RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Not recorded'. The prediction provides a list of negative symptoms, which is a valid and helpful addition, but it doesn't match the 'Not recorded' status of the GT. [RESULT]: 1"

        "illicit_drug": "[REASON]: The prediction 'denies use' is semantically equivalent to the GT 'Denies illicit drug use'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "allergies": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'latex; penicillin', which is semantically equivalent to the GT 'latex; Penicillins'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'sister: lung cancer; sister: breast cancer; mother: diabetes; mother: stroke', which covers the key information in the GT 'Sister: lung cancer; breast cancer; Mother: DM; CVA'. The GT also mentions 'No family history of melanoma', which is not included in the prediction, but the core positive family history is present. [RESULT]: 3",
        "medical_device": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'stents', which is a medical device mentioned in the GT's medical history section ('multiple coronary stents'). The GT explicitly states 'Not recorded' for the medical_device field itself, which is contradictory to the information provided elsewhere in the GT. However, the prediction extracts a relevant medical device mentioned in the overall context. Given the ambiguity in the GT, extracting a mentioned device is partially correct. [RESULT]: 3",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'coronary artery disease; stents; low blood sugar; adrenal insufficiency (suspected); constipation'. This covers some key aspects of the GT's extensive medical history ('CAD s/p 3 vessel bypass surgery; multiple coronary stents', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Generalized fatigue c/w adrenal insufficiency'). However, it misses many other significant conditions listed in the GT (melanoma, carotid artery disease, spinal stenosis, BPH, hypertension, diabetes type II, hearing loss, no history of PUD). [RESULT]: 2",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT lists 'HYPOTENSIVE'. The prediction lists 'tiredness; low blood pressure; fever'. While low blood pressure is semantically equivalent to hypotensive, the prediction includes additional items that are not the primary chief complaint listed in the GT. [RESULT]: 3",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists all the medications present in the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'tired for a few days; low blood pressure (92/50); fever (102.1°F); chest discomfort (like indigestion, brief); low blood sugar (30); decreased appetite; weight loss; sleep disturbance (sleeps during day, not well at night); pain; abdominal discomfort (mild, brief)'. This covers several key points from the GT ('Hypotension; BP dropped to 92/50 after chemo infusion this morning', 'Febrile with rectal temp of 102.1F', 'Mild, fleeting chest and abdominal discomfort described as \"indigestion\" lasting for minutes', 'Hypoglycemia (one week ago, FSBG=30)', 'Generalized fatigue c/w adrenal insufficiency'). However, it includes additional items (decreased appetite, weight loss, sleep disturbance, pain) not explicitly mentioned in the GT's present illness positive section. It also misses 'Orthostasis at time of BP drop'. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The GT lists 'Denies SOB; Denies palpitations'. The prediction lists 'shortness of breath; palpitations; leg swelling; anxiety; depression'. The prediction correctly identifies the denial of shortness of breath and palpitations but includes additional denied symptoms not present in the GT. [RESULT]: 3"

        "tobacco": "[REASON]: The prediction 'No smoking' is semantically equivalent to 'Denies tobacco use'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "alcohol": "[REASON]: The prediction 'Occasional drinking' is partially correct as it captures the occasional nature but misses the frequency and amount. [RESULT]: 3",
        "illicit_drug": "[REASON]: The prediction 'No drug use' is semantically equivalent to 'Denies illicit drug use'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction 'Non-contributory' is an exact match to the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction lists several key medical history items but misses several others present in the GT. [RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction includes abdominal pain and nausea, which are part of the chief complaint, but also includes blood in stool which is a symptom, not the primary chief complaint. [RESULT]: 3",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The GT provides a numerical pain score, while the prediction states it was not recorded and provides a predicted score. This is not a direct comparison of the recorded pain level. [RESULT]: 1",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists several medications from the GT but misses others. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction captures several positive symptoms from the GT but also includes symptoms not explicitly stated in the GT (decreased appetite, weight loss) and misses some details (location of pain, onset). [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction lists several negative findings, some of which are not explicitly stated as negative in the GT (vomiting, diarrhea, changes in bowel habits, history of substance use, history of mental health concerns). The GT focuses on specific denials related to the current illness. [RESULT]: 1"
    },
    "23604831": {
        "exercise": "[REASON]: The prediction accurately captures the type of exercise mentioned in the GT, omitting the frequency which is a minor detail in this context. 'light walking' and 'stretching' are present in both. [RESULT]: 4",
        "tobacco": "[REASON]: The prediction states 'denies smoking' which is semantically equivalent to 'Never used tobacco' in the context of a medical history. [RESULT]: 4",
        "alcohol": "[REASON]: The prediction states 'denies drinking' which is semantically equivalent to 'Denies alcohol use'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "illicit_drug": "[REASON]: The prediction states 'denies using drugs' which is semantically equivalent to 'Denies illicit drug use'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "allergies": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'Penicillin' which is the core allergen mentioned in the GT 'Penicillins'. The pluralization difference is negligible. [RESULT]: 4",
        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction accurately captures the key points from the GT regarding family history: father with HTN and no history of early strokes, MI, bleeding disorders, or clotting disorders. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction captures several key elements from the GT's medical history: high blood pressure (Hypertension), digestive issues (GERD, Constipation), fall a few years ago (Fall onto left wrist and hip years ago), and occasional pain in left wrist and hip (Intermittent left wrist and hip pain since fall). It misses HLD and Insomnia, and the intermittent numbness in both hands. [RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT lists 'Hypertension, L Arm numbness'. The prediction lists 'numbness and odd sensations on left side'. While the numbness is captured, the hypertension is missed, and the description of the sensation is slightly different but related. [RESULT]: 3",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists felodipine, lisinopril, and verapamil, which are present in the GT. It also includes 'medications for digestion' and 'medications for insomnia', which correspond to omeprazole/sucralfate and melatonin in the GT, respectively. Nystatin is missed. The prediction uses categories for some medications rather than specific names. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction captures the onset time, location (left side, head, arm, leg), type of sensation (warm, pressure), improvement, history of similar symptoms, and the difference from past symptoms. It misses the last known well time and the difficulty walking due to sensation. [RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction includes 'denies weakness' which is in the GT. It adds 'denies vision problems' and 'denies difficulty speaking' which are not in the GT. It misses 'Denies symptoms on right side of body'. [RESULT]: 2"

    "21413379": {
        "occupation": "[REASON]: The prediction accurately reflects the patient's retired status as stated in the GT. Semantic equivalence is achieved despite minor case difference. [RESULT]: 4",
        "exercise": "[REASON]: The prediction captures the type and frequency of exercise mentioned in the GT. Semantic equivalence is achieved despite minor phrasing differences. [RESULT]: 4",
        "tobacco": "[REASON]: The prediction states the patient denies smoking, which is semantically equivalent to 'Never used tobacco' in the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "alcohol": "[REASON]: The prediction states the patient drinks rarely, which is semantically equivalent to 'Rarely consumes alcohol' in the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "illicit_drug": "[REASON]: The prediction states the patient denies illicit drug use, which is semantically equivalent to 'Never used illicit drugs' in the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "allergies": "[REASON]: The prediction lists the exact same allergies as the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction mentions the father's CHF and a general statement about family history of various cancers, but misses specific details about the mother's conditions, brother's skin CA, aunt's breast CA, MGM's breast CA, and uncle's colon CA. [RESULT]: 2",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction includes most of the medical history items from the GT, using semantically equivalent terms for HLD and HTN. However, it misses esophagitis, osteopenia, and osteoporosis. [RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction includes chest pain and epigastric discomfort, which are related to the chief complaint of Chest pain, NSTEMI and the present illness details in the GT. However, it misses the NSTEMI part of the chief complaint. [RESULT]: 3",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The GT provides a numerical rating for pain. The prediction provides a description of pain and numerical ratings for different types of pain, which is a different format and includes information not explicitly in the GT's 'pain' field (though present in 'present_illness_positive'). The numerical values provided in the prediction are also different from the single value in the GT. [RESULT]: 1",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists several medications that are present in the GT, but it misses clotrimazole-betamethasone, diclofenac sodium [Voltaren], fluorouracil, and triamcinolone acetonide. [RESULT]: 2",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction captures most of the positive present illness details from the GT, using semantically equivalent phrasing. It includes intermittent epigastric pain, pain worse postprandial, pain worse at night, pain worse yesterday evening after large meal, bilateral axillary radiation, nausea, and several episodes of emesis. It misses 'symptoms different than normal gastroparesis' and adds 'chest pain' which is part of the chief complaint but not explicitly listed in the GT's positive present illness details. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction includes 'no shortness of breath' which is in the GT. However, it misses 'lightheadedness' and adds several other negative findings not present in the GT's negative present illness section. [RESULT]: 2"

    "27038358": {
        "tobacco": "[REASON]: The prediction accurately reflects that the patient is a former smoker who quit, although it doesn't specify the quit date as the GT does. This is a minor omission and the core information is present. [RESULT]: 4",
        "alcohol": "[REASON]: The prediction states the patient rarely drinks, which is consistent with the GT's description of rarely consuming alcohol. [RESULT]: 4",
        "illicit_drug": "[REASON]: Both the GT and prediction state that the patient denies illicit drug use. [RESULT]: 4",
        "allergies": "[REASON]: Both the GT and prediction state that the patient has no known allergies. [RESULT]: 4",
        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: Both the GT and prediction state that the father had prostate cancer. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medical_device": "[REASON]: Both the GT and prediction mention a stent. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction mentions gastric bypass surgery and a stent, which are present in the GT. However, it misses hypothyroidism and HTN. [RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT states \"Abd pain, SBO\". The prediction states \"stomach pain and vomiting after eating\". While related to abdominal issues, the prediction does not mention SBO (Small Bowel Obstruction), which is a significant part of the chief complaint in the GT. [RESULT]: 2",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The GT lists pain as 0, which seems incorrect given the chief complaint and positive present illness. The prediction lists pain as 7 or 8, which is more consistent with the other information provided. Assuming the GT value for pain is an error, the prediction provides a plausible pain score. However, directly comparing the provided values, they are completely different. [RESULT]: 1",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists all the medications mentioned in the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction includes several positive symptoms mentioned in the GT (pain started yesterday while eating, sharp pain in upper stomach, pain gets worse each time it comes back, vomiting after eating). It also includes additional details not in the GT (eating solid foods makes pain worse, pain gets a little better after vomiting, lost some weight, poor appetite, feeling weak, stress at work). While it includes the core positive symptoms, it also adds information not present in the GT. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction includes some negative symptoms from the GT (no fever, no chills, pain does not radiate to back or shoulders - which relates to nonradiating in GT). It misses CP/SOB, dysuria, and melena. It also includes additional negative symptoms not in the GT (no changes in bowel movements, no recent infections). [RESULT]: 3"

    "27283178": {
        "exercise": "[REASON]: The prediction mentions 'Moving around helps pain', which is related to physical activity but does not specify the type, frequency, or duration of exercise as provided in the GT. It's a related concept but not a direct match to the exercise profile. [RESULT]: 2",
        "tobacco": "[REASON]: The prediction 'No smoking' is semantically equivalent to the GT 'Never smoked'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "alcohol": "[REASON]: The prediction 'Doesn't drink much' is semantically equivalent to the GT 'Rarely consumes alcohol'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "illicit_drug": "[REASON]: The prediction 'No drug use' is semantically equivalent to the GT 'Denies illicit drug use'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "allergies": "[REASON]: The GT states 'No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions'. The prediction states 'No allergies; Fructose intolerance'. While the GT doesn't list fructose intolerance as an allergy, the prediction includes 'No allergies' which aligns with the GT's primary statement. However, it adds fructose intolerance, which is listed under medical history in the GT. This makes it partially correct regarding the 'no allergies' part but introduces information from another section. [RESULT]: 3",
        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'Mother had diabetes (older); Brother had diabetes', which is semantically equivalent to the GT 'Mother adult-onset diabetes; Brother adult-onset diabetes'. The addition of '(older)' for the mother is a minor detail that doesn't change the core information. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medical_device": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Not recorded'. The prediction states 'Pen needles for insulin'. The GT indicates no information was available, while the prediction provides a specific medical device used by the patient (which is also mentioned in the medication list in the GT). Therefore, the prediction is incorrect compared to the GT's statement of 'Not recorded'. [RESULT]: 1",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The GT lists multiple medical conditions (HTN, Rectal cancer, Colonic adenoma, Small bowel obstruction, Fructose intolerance, Esophagitis, Gastritis, Anemia, Retinal artery embolism, ASD, Basal cell carcinoma, Lung nodule). The prediction only lists 'Diabetes; Bowel obstruction (10 years ago, surgery)'. This is only a small subset of the conditions listed in the GT. [RESULT]: 2",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction 'Belly pain' is semantically equivalent to the GT 'Abd pain'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The GT provides a numerical pain score of 7. The prediction provides a numerical pain score of 8. While both are numerical scores for pain, they are different values. [RESULT]: 3",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists most of the medications from the GT (Aspirin, Hydrochlorothiazide, Insulin glargine, Humulin 70/30, Lisinopril, Metformin, Simvastatin). It is missing 'pen needle, diabetic [BD Ultra-Fine Short Pen Needle]' which is listed in the GT's medication list. Therefore, it is partially correct. [RESULT]: 3",
        "arrival_transport": "[REASON]: The prediction 'Walked' is semantically equivalent to the GT 'WALK IN'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The GT lists 'Diarrhea since; Nausea since (currently not nauseous); Abdominal pain started this morning (better with morphine); Not feeling hungry; Passing gas; Last bowel movement regular formed brown stool at 4'. The prediction lists 'Belly pain (middle, moves around, crampy, squeezing, tight, comes and goes, lasts 20-30 minutes, worse when lying down, better with movement, worse after eating vegetable); Diarrhea; Feeling sick to stomach; No appetite; Gas; Belly sore to touch; Belly feels hard; Tired (due to pain and not eating)'. The prediction includes many more details about the abdominal pain and adds 'Belly sore to touch', 'Belly feels hard', and 'Tired'. It also rephrases 'Nausea since (currently not nauseous)' as 'Feeling sick to stomach'. While it includes some of the GT items (Diarrhea, No appetite, Gas), it misses the detail about the last bowel movement and adds several other positive findings. It's partially correct but significantly different in detail and content. [RESULT]: 2",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The GT lists 'Fever; Chills; Dyspnea; Chest pain; Vomiting'. The prediction lists 'No fever; No vomiting; No chills; No swelling in abdomen'. The prediction includes 'No fever', 'No vomiting', and 'No chills', which are the negative findings corresponding to 'Fever', 'Vomiting', and 'Chills' in the GT. However, it misses 'Dyspnea' and 'Chest pain' and adds 'No swelling in abdomen'. It is partially correct. [RESULT]: 3"

        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction only mentions 'pneumonia few weeks ago', which is part of the present illness in the GT, and misses the other medical history items (depression, allergic rhinitis, osteopenia, history of hep A). [RESULT]: 1",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction lists several symptoms that are part of the chief complaint and present illness in the GT, but it is more detailed than the concise chief complaint in the GT. [RESULT]: 3",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The prediction provides a numerical value for pain, but it is different from the GT value. [RESULT]: 1",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists the same medications as the GT, with minor variations in spelling (cefuroxime instead of cefuroxime axetil). [RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction lists many positive symptoms consistent with the GT, although the phrasing and level of detail differ. It captures the core issues of cough, dyspnea, fever, body aches, and sputum. [RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction lists several negative findings, some of which are not present in the GT (wheezing, night sweats, recent travel, exposure to sick people, swelling in legs or ankles). It only partially matches the GT by mentioning 'no chest pain'. [RESULT]: 2"
    },
    "29945704": {
        "exercise": "[REASON]: The prediction 'limited physical activity' is semantically equivalent to the GT 'Limited activity due to health conditions'. Both indicate restricted exercise due to health issues. [RESULT]: 4",
        "tobacco": "[REASON]: The prediction 'denies smoking' is semantically equivalent to the GT 'Denies tobacco use'. Smoking is a form of tobacco use. [RESULT]: 4",

It does include HTN, DM2 with nephropathy, CKD IV, diabetic retinopathy, senile nuclear cataract, and Debridement surgery for non healing ulcers (non-healing ulcers). [RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT lists 'Weakness' as the chief complaint. The prediction lists several symptoms including 'weakness in right leg', 'difficulty lifting foot', 'difficulty writing', 'difficulty speaking clearly', and 'unintentional weight loss'. While weakness is included, the prediction provides a more detailed description of the symptoms rather than just the chief complaint. [RESULT]: 2",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The GT states the pain score is 0. The prediction states the pain score is 7. These are completely different values. [RESULT]: 1",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists all the medications present in the GT, although it omits the dosage information for acetaminophen-codeine. [RESULT]: 4",

        "medical_device": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Not recorded', while the prediction lists 'inhalers for COPD'. While inhalers are medical devices, the GT explicitly states they were not recorded. Therefore, the prediction is inconsistent with the GT. [RESULT]: 1",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction lists COPD, HLD, and osteoporosis, which are present in the GT. It also includes 'cancers (past)', which is a summary of the detailed cancer history in the GT (stage I infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the right breast s/p lumpectomy and sentinel node bx; s/p chemotherapy; left upper lobe lung adenoCa; left lower lobe carncinoma s/p excision; s/p radiation therapy). The prediction is a good summary but lacks the detail of the GT. [RESULT]: 3",

        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'ciprofloxacin', 'Imodium', and 'Metamucil'. These medications are mentioned in the GT's medication list or the 'present_illness_positive' section (Imodium and Metamucil use). It doesn't list all medications from the GT but captures some key ones. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'stomach swollen since yesterday morning', 'no bowel movement since yesterday', 'no gas since yesterday', 'nausea since yesterday morning', and 'vomiting since yesterday morning'. These are all consistent with the GT's 'progressive abdominal distention', 'abscence of BM', 'intermittent flatus', 'nausea', and 'repetitive episodes of NBNB vomiting', all noted as since yesterday morning.

        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists all the medications mentioned in the GT: 'aspirin; terazosin; fish oil; multivitamin'. 'Aspir-81' is a specific dosage of Aspirin, and the prediction lists 'aspirin', which is semantically equivalent in this context. [RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction lists some positive findings from the GT (chest pain, right side pain/abdominal pain, trouble breathing with exercise) but misses several key findings like elevated troponin, ECG changes, and pain relief with SLN. It also includes some findings not explicitly in the GT's positive list (pressure, comes and goes, worse with movement, better with rest). [RESULT]: 2",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction lists some negative findings (pain moves around, constant pain, sweating) that are semantically equivalent to some of the GT's negative findings (radiation of pain, diaphoresis).

        "tobacco": "[REASON]: The GT specifies 'prior smoker; 20 py smoker', while the prediction states 'quit smoking'. Both indicate a history of smoking, but the prediction lacks the detail of the smoking history (20 pack-years). Therefore, it is partially correct. [RESULT]: 3",
        "alcohol": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Does not consume alcohol', and the prediction says 'denies alcohol use'. These are semantically equivalent. [RESULT]: 4",
        "illicit_drug": "[REASON]: The GT says 'Denies illicit drug use', and the prediction says 'denies drug use'. The prediction is slightly less specific by omitting 'illicit', but the meaning is largely the same in a medical context. [RESULT]: 4",

        "medical_device": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Not recorded', while the prediction mentions 'inhaler (occasional use)'. The prediction provides information where the GT states none was recorded. This is a discrepancy, but the prediction provides a plausible medical device given the patient's history of COPD. However, it's not consistent with the GT's lack of recording. [RESULT]: 1",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The GT lists several conditions (HTN, CKD, COPD, Pulm Nodule, Brain aneurysm s/p coils, treated hep C, L mastectomy, ovarian cyst, Lung cancer stage IIIA NSCLC). The prediction lists a subset (COPD, lung cancer, radiation therapy for lung cancer). The prediction is partially correct but misses several key conditions. [RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT lists 'Dyspnea'. The prediction lists 'trouble breathing; cough'. 'Trouble breathing' is semantically equivalent to dyspnea, but the prediction also includes cough, which is not listed as the chief complaint in the GT. It's partially correct but includes extra information. [RESULT]: 3",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The GT lists many medications. The prediction lists a subset of those medications (labetalol, furosemide, acetaminophen) and also includes 'inhaler (occasional use)', which is not explicitly listed in the GT's medication list but could be related to the medical device mentioned in the prediction. The prediction is only partially correct as it misses most of the medications. [RESULT]: 2",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The GT lists several positive symptoms (malaise, dizziness, fever, productive cough of yellow sputum, intermittent chills, subjective fevers, intermittent pleuritic chest pain, feeling unwell since after receiving RT). The prediction lists some overlapping symptoms (trouble breathing since after radiation therapy, bad cough since after radiation therapy, productive cough with yellow sputum, fever, chills, intermittent chest pain, especially when coughing, lying down makes breathing harder). There is overlap in cough, fever, chills, chest pain, and relation to RT, but also differences and additional details in the prediction. It's partially correct. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The GT lists 'sick contacts; night sweats; diarrhea; constipation'. The prediction lists 'denies recent infections before symptoms started; denies changes in weight; denies changes in appetite; denies swelling in legs or feet'. There is no overlap between the negative symptoms listed in the GT and the prediction. [RESULT]: 1"

        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction covers all the key points from the GT's medical history, using slightly different phrasing but conveying the same information. It also adds 'neurogenic bladder' which is highly related to paraplegia and UTIs but not explicitly in the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction provides a more detailed chief complaint that includes the core issue (UTI) and associated symptoms mentioned in the present illness positive section, which is consistent with the GT's simple 'UTI'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The prediction provides the same pain score as the GT, although formatted as a string. [RESULT]: 4",

        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'arthritis', 'high blood pressure', and 'GERD', which correspond to Rheumatoid Arthritis, Hypertension, and Gastroesophageal reflux disease in the GT. It omits 'Prostate cancer s/p prostatectomy'. This is a partial match. [RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction 'chest pain while dancing' captures the core of the chief complaint, which is chest pain, and adds context from the present illness. The GT is more specific about cardiac features. It's a reasonable summary but not an exact match. [RESULT]: 3",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The GT states the pain is 0, which is likely an error in the GT as the present illness describes constant discomfort 3.5-4/10. The prediction states '3 or 4', which aligns with the description in the present illness. Assuming the GT's '0' is an error and the present illness is correct, the prediction is consistent with the detailed description. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists omeprazole, Methotrexate, and prednisone, which are present in the GT. It generalizes felodipine and lisinopril to 'blood pressure medication'. This is a partial match. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction captures several key positive findings from the GT, including chest pain while dancing, duration (on and off for a week), radiation to shoulders, worse with exertion, shortness of breath with exertion, and sweating. It omits some details like substernal location, constant discomfort level, and worsening at ED presentation. It also adds 'dull ache' and 'heartburn recently' which are not explicitly in the GT's positive findings but could be inferred or related. It's a good summary but not a complete match. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Not recorded'. The prediction lists several negative findings. Therefore, the prediction is inconsistent with the GT. [RESULT]: 1"

        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction includes 'Fever', 'Hard to breathe' (semantically equivalent to Dyspnea), and 'Burning urination' (semantically equivalent to Dysuria). It also includes 'Flank pain' and 'Chest pain' which are mentioned in the present illness but not explicitly listed as chief complaints in the GT. [RESULT]: 3",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The prediction provides the same numerical value for pain as the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists all the medications mentioned in the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction captures several of the positive findings from the GT, including fever, burning urination, right flank pain, black stools, emesis (vomit), fatigue (tired), hematuria (blood in urine), and chest pain. It misses general weakness, gradually worsening shortness of breath, malaise, and intermittent easy bruising and bleeding. It also adds increased urination frequency and no appetite which are not in the GT. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction lists different negative findings than the GT. [RESULT]: 1"

        "allergies": "[REASON]: The prediction lists the exact same allergies as the ground truth. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction provides very vague and incomplete information compared to the detailed medical history in the ground truth. 'Water pipe in brain' is a very poor description of a VP shunt, and 'bad infections' is a general term that doesn't capture the specific infections listed. [RESULT]: 1",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction 'right side pain' is a reasonable, though slightly less specific, description of 'R Flank pain'. Flank pain is a type of side pain. [RESULT]: 3",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists the exact same medications as the ground truth. [RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction captures several key positive symptoms from the ground truth, such as right side pain (flank pain), pain radiating to groin, nausea, chills, cloudy urine, and bad smelling urine. However, it misses important details about the duration and acuity of the pain, the left leg symptoms (redness, swelling), and the chronic posterior ulcer symptoms (enlarged, draining). It also includes symptoms not present in the GT (tired, stressed, eat different). [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'no difficulty urinating' which is semantically equivalent to 'dyruria denied'. However, it misses 'hematuria denied' and 'fevers denied' and includes 'no problem with bowel' and 'no weight loss' which are not in the GT. [RESULT]: 2"

        "pain": "[REASON]: The prediction states '0', which is consistent with the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction states that the patient takes medications and a list is available, but it does not list the specific medications as provided in the GT. [RESULT]: 1",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction includes dyspnea (trouble breathing), weakness, pleuritic chest pain, and fatigue (tired), which are all present in the GT. It also adds more detail about the onset and nature of the symptoms. [RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction includes the absence of fever and chills, which are in the GT. It also mentions no chest pain now, which is not explicitly in the GT's negative symptoms but is related to the positive symptom of chest pain. It misses cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, and leg pain. [RESULT]: 2"

        "age": "[REASON]: The predicted age is the same as the ground truth age. [RESULT]: 4",
        "gender": "[REASON]: The predicted gender 'woman' is semantically equivalent to the ground truth 'F'. [RESULT]: 4",

        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The predicted medical history includes some of the conditions from the ground truth but misses several significant diagnoses like bladder carcinoma, lung cancer, IBD, and surgical history. It also includes 'arthritis' and 'dysuria' which are mentioned in the present illness but not explicitly in the medical history section of the GT. [RESULT]: 2",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The predicted chief complaint includes 'chills' and 'shaking' which are present in the positive symptoms but not explicitly listed as the chief complaint in the GT. It also includes 'body aches' which is part of the GT chief complaint. The GT chief complaint is 'Body aches, Headache', and the prediction is 'chills; shaking; body aches'. [RESULT]: 2",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The predicted medication list includes some of the medications from the ground truth but misses several, and includes 'coenzyme A' which is mentioned in the present illness as having run out, not as a current medication. [RESULT]: 2",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The predicted positive symptoms capture the core issues of chills, shaking, and body aches, and mention abdominal pain and itchy skin. However, it misses details like increased urinary frequency and the specific timing of some symptoms. It also includes 'decreased appetite' which is not in the GT. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The predicted negative symptoms include 'fever' which is in the GT, but misses several other key negative symptoms from the GT (hematuria, SOB, BRBPR, nausea, vomiting) and includes symptoms not mentioned in the GT (cough, sore throat, difficulty breathing, changes in bowel habits, weight loss).

        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction captures the key points of the family history: brother with hemochromatosis, father and two brothers with sudden heart issues, and no lung problems. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction lists some of the medical history items (heart failure, heart surgery, swelling) but misses several others like pulmonary hypertension, cirrhosis, CKD, AFib, sleep apnea, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, hemochromatosis carrier, ascites, and recurrent urosepsis. [RESULT]: 2",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Tachycardia' as the chief complaint. The prediction lists 'puffiness; belly tightness', which are symptoms mentioned in the present illness but not the primary chief complaint. [RESULT]: 1",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The prediction correctly identifies that there is no pain reported, although it adds '(predicted)' which is not in the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists only two medications (bumetanide, metoprolol) out of the thirteen listed in the GT. [RESULT]: 2",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction includes 'puffiness', 'belly tightness', and 'swelling in legs and belly', which relate to the increased abdominal distension and bilateral lower extremity edema. However, it misses the weight gain and the wife's concern about salty foods. It also adds 'increased urination', 'shortness of breath', and 'fatigue' which are not in the GT's positive findings. [RESULT]: 2",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The GT explicitly states 'Not recorded'. The prediction lists several negative findings (pain, nausea, vomiting, changes in bowel habits, chest pain) which are not present in the GT. [RESULT]: 1"

[RESULT]: 2",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT lists 'Seizure' as the chief complaint. The prediction lists 'Shaking; Weakness; Confusion'. While shaking and weakness are related to the seizure event described in the HPI, 'Seizure' is the primary chief complaint. The prediction is related but not the exact chief complaint. [RESULT]: 2",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists only a subset of the medications from the GT (aspirin, digoxin, furosemide, warfarin). It misses docusate sodium, finasteride, lisinopril, metoprolol succinate, oxycodone, pravastatin, and tamsulosin. [RESULT]: 2",
