The GT lists several specific conditions including 'ulcerative colitis', 'c diff colitis', and 'recurrent pouch problems; pouchitis; c. diffitis', which are more detailed than the prediction. The prediction is partially correct but lacks the specificity of the GT. [RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT lists 'Constipation'. The prediction lists 'stomach swollen; no bowel movement since yesterday; nauseous; vomiting'. While these symptoms are related to constipation, the chief complaint in the GT is specifically constipation. The prediction lists symptoms that contribute to the chief complaint but not the chief complaint itself. [RESULT]: 2",

The GT lists several specific medical conditions including 'Polycystic kidney disease s/p renal transplant' and mentions a 'flu-like illness several weeks ago' in the present illness section, not the medical history. The prediction is incomplete and inaccurate regarding the medical history. [RESULT]: 2",

        "medical_device": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Not recorded', while the prediction lists 'EpiPen'. The EpiPen is listed as a medication in the GT, not a medical device. Therefore, the prediction is incorrect. [RESULT]: 1",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction includes most of the conditions listed in the GT but omits 'carpal tunnel syndrome', 'Dupuytren contracture', and 'Open cholecystectomy'.

It also adds poor appetite and fatigue, which are not in the GT. The GT specifies 'acute onset nausea' and 'acute onset vomiting' and 'acute onset 'deep' abdominal pain right side', which the prediction captures the essence of. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The GT only lists 'bloody emesis' as a negative finding. The prediction lists several negative findings, none of which are 'bloody emesis'. Therefore, the prediction is completely incorrect compared to the GT for this specific item. [RESULT]: 1"

        "alcohol": "[REASON]: The ground truth states 'Not recorded', while the prediction states 'Doesn't really drink'. These are not semantically equivalent. 'Not recorded' means the information is unavailable, while 'Doesn't really drink' implies the information was obtained and the patient drinks very little or not at all. [RESULT]: 1",
        "allergies": "[REASON]: Both the ground truth and the prediction state 'No Known Allergies'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction only includes 'Borderline diabetes' and 'hyperlipidemia' from the extensive list of medical history provided in the ground truth. It misses several other significant conditions. [RESULT]: 2",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The ground truth states 'Visual changes', while the prediction lists 'Blurry vision; unsteadiness'. Blurry vision is a type of visual change, and unsteadiness is also a significant symptom mentioned in the present illness. The prediction captures the core issues, although it's not an exact match to the single chief complaint listed in the GT. [RESULT]: 3",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The ground truth indicates a pain score of 0, and the prediction also states '0'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'Acyclovir; Zonegran; a few others'. The ground truth lists 'acyclovir, Zonegran, atorvastatin, nitroglycerin, propranolol, aspirin'. The prediction correctly identifies two medications but misses several others and uses a vague phrase 'a few others'. [RESULT]: 2",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction captures several key positive symptoms from the ground truth, including blurry vision, unsteadiness, feeling unbalanced, lightheadedness, and feeling like they might fall. It also includes the onset time for some symptoms, similar to the GT. [RESULT]: 4",

        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction provides a very high-level summary of the medical history (diabetes, high blood pressure, cancer, surgeries) but misses many specific conditions listed in the GT (pulmonary HTN, OSA, AS, chronic hypoxic respiratory failure, HL, Sweet's syndrome, pyoderma gangrenosum, diverticulitis, overactive bladder, recurrent cystitis, urge incontinence, CKD, HLD, COPD). It only captures a small part of the detailed GT. [RESULT]: 2",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction includes weakness, unsteadiness, chest pain, and nausea. The GT lists Chest pain, Nausea, and Weakness. The prediction adds unsteadiness, which is mentioned in the present illness positive section of the GT, but not as a chief complaint. However, it captures the main chief complaints listed in the GT.

The GT lists Aspirin, Calcium Carbonate, dapsone, glipizide, Multivitamin, sertraline, solifenacin [Vesicare]. The prediction includes some of the medications but misses Calcium Carbonate, sertraline, and solifenacin. It also generalizes Multivitamin to 'vitamins'. It is partially correct. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction includes weakness, unsteadiness, difficulty getting out of bed, which are present in the GT. However, it also includes chest pain, nausea, dull chest pain, chest pain worse with movement, chest pain better with rest, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing with movement, fatigue, low appetite, and possible weight loss, which are not explicitly listed in the GT's present illness positive section. The GT's present illness positive is very specific to weakness and unsteadiness. The prediction includes some correct information but also adds information not present in the GT for this specific key. [RESULT]: 2",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction lists fevers, chills, signs of infection, recent stress, and changes in daily routine as negative findings. The GT states 'full 10 point review of systems otherwise negative'. The prediction provides specific examples of negative findings, which are consistent with a general negative review of systems, but it doesn't explicitly match the GT's phrasing or imply a full 10-point review. It's a partially correct interpretation. [RESULT]: 3"

        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists all medications present in the GT and in the same order. [RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction includes most of the positive findings from the GT (Woke up at 2:30 AM with strange feeling in chest, Chest pressure, Indigestion-like feeling in chest, Pain in right jaw). It also includes additional details not explicitly in the GT but potentially inferred from the context (Symptoms started slowly and got stronger, Felt symptoms for about an hour before taking aspirin, Felt nervous and unsure, Felt physical, not just in head). It misses the specific detail about receiving 4 aspirin 81mg prior to arrival. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction includes some of the negative findings from the GT (Denies trouble breathing, Denies feeling sick yesterday, Denies similar symptoms in the past). It misses 'arm pain', 'nausea', 'cough', 'fever', and 'new edema'. [RESULT]: 3"

The GT lists 'Prostate cancer s/p resection; CAD s/p CABG; DM2; HTN; Cataracts s/p laser surgery'. The prediction captures the major conditions (cancer, heart problems, diabetes, HTN) but misses the specific details (Prostate cancer s/p resection, CAD s/p CABG, DM2, HTN) and the cataracts. It is partially correct. [RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT states 'S/P CVA'. The prediction lists 'Left-sided numbness; headache; wobbly walk'. While these symptoms are consistent with a CVA, the prediction does not explicitly state 'S/P CVA'. It describes the symptoms rather than the diagnosis provided in the GT. [RESULT]: 2",

The prediction lists 'Atorvastatin; lisinopril; pills for diabetes; pills for high blood pressure'. It correctly identifies atorvastatin and lisinopril but generalizes the others to 'pills for diabetes' and 'pills for high blood pressure', missing Cymbalta and diclofenac sodium. It is partially correct. [RESULT]: 3",

It captures the left-sided numbness (face, arm) with the correct onset, the headache with the correct onset, and the wobbly walk. It misses the intermittent nature of the numbness initially and the tinnitus. It is mostly correct but misses some details. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The GT lists a comprehensive set of denied symptoms. The prediction lists a different, less comprehensive set of denied symptoms.

'HTN' is the medical abbreviation for hypertension, which is high blood pressure. The prediction provides the full term for the abbreviation in the GT. The meaning is the same. [RESULT]: 4",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT states 'UTI COMPLAINTS'. The prediction lists specific symptoms associated with a UTI (Dysuria; fever; chills; sweats; right flank pain). While the prediction provides more detail, the GT's chief complaint is a summary term for these symptoms. The prediction is consistent with the underlying reason for the visit as indicated by the GT. [RESULT]: 3",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The GT provides a numerical value for pain (4). The prediction also provides the same numerical value (4). The information is identical. [RESULT]: 4",

The prediction includes the medication listed in the GT and adds information about recent antibiotic use, which is relevant given the chief complaint and present illness details. The prediction is partially correct as it includes the GT information but also adds other relevant details not explicitly in the GT's medication list. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The GT lists several positive symptoms with onset dates and details about previous treatments. The prediction lists many of the same symptoms (dysuria, fever, chills, sweats, R flank pain, intermittent nausea) and adds others (increased urinary urgency, pressure, decreased appetite, fatigue, stress). It also omits the specific onset dates and details about the previous medications mentioned in the GT. The prediction captures many of the key positive symptoms but lacks the specific temporal and treatment details present in the GT. [RESULT]: 3",

        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The GT lists specific positive findings from the present illness. The prediction lists patient-reported symptoms which are related to the present illness but are not the same specific findings as in the GT (e.g., diffuse GGO on CT chest, possible UTI on UA). Some overlap exists (agitated, change in behavior/mental status vs agitated, not like myself, feeling strange, don’t want to take medicine), but the prediction includes many items not in the GT and misses several from the GT. [RESULT]: 2",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The GT lists specific symptoms that are denied. The prediction also lists symptoms that are denied, with some overlap (weakness). However, many items are different between the two lists. [RESULT]: 2"

However, it misses 'CKD - analgesic nephropathy - baseline Cr 2', 'Immunosuppression of IgM subclass', and 'Hip surgery'. Therefore, it is partially correct. [RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT lists 'Chest pain' as the chief complaint. The prediction lists 'chest pain; shortness of breath'. While chest pain is included, the addition of shortness of breath makes it partially correct but not an exact match to the single chief complaint listed in the GT. [RESULT]: 3",

        "pain": "[REASON]: The GT specifies the pain score as 0, which seems incorrect given the description of pain in the present illness. The prediction gives a pain score of '4', which aligns better with the description of discomfort as '3.5-4/10' in the GT's present illness section. Assuming the GT's pain score of 0 is an error, the prediction's score of 4 is consistent with the detailed description. [RESULT]: 4",
