        "alcohol": "[REASON]: The prediction captures the core information that the patient reports occasional social alcohol use. While it doesn't include the detail about the type and frequency not being specified, the main point is present. [RESULT]: 3",
        "illicit_drug": "[REASON]: The prediction accurately states that the patient denies illicit drug use, which is the same information as the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "allergies": "[REASON]: The prediction lists all the allergies mentioned in the GT exactly. [RESULT]: 4",
        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction includes all the family medical history details provided in the GT, with slightly different phrasing but the same meaning. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medical_device": "[REASON]: The prediction accurately states that the patient has a Foley catheter due to obstructive uropathy, which is consistent with the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction lists all the medical history items from the GT. It also includes 'treatments for bladder cancer' which is implied by 'bladder mets' and 'Bladder cancer w/ recurrent UTIs & pyelonephritis' in the GT, and 'left nephrectomy for renal cancer' which is a more specific way of stating 'kidney cancer s/p L nephrectomy' and 'renal cancer s/p L nephrectomy'. The prediction is comprehensive and accurate. [RESULT]: 4",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction includes 'right flank and back pain extending to right groin' and 'intermittent hematuria' as chief complaints. The GT lists 'R Flank pain' as the chief complaint, but the present illness positive section elaborates on the pain location and includes intermittent hematuria. The prediction seems to synthesize the chief complaint and key positive findings, which is a reasonable interpretation, but it doesn't strictly match the single item listed as 'chiefcomplaint' in the GT. [RESULT]: 3",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists all the medications from the GT. It omits the brand names and the specific 'blood sugar diagnostic', but the core list of prescribed medications is complete and accurate. [RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction includes the right flank and back pain extending to the right groin and intermittent hematuria, which are key positive findings in the GT. It adds details about the pain characteristics (dull ache, constant, worsens when lying down) and hematuria frequency, which are not explicitly in the GT's positive findings list but might be inferred from a full clinical note. It omits the R-sided abd pain and CVA tenderness upon arrival ED, and the sternal CP. Therefore, it is partially correct. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'nausea', 'vomiting', 'fever', 'recent weight loss', and 'changes in appetite' as negative findings. The GT lists 'fevers (at home)', 'frank pyuria', 'respiratory complaints', and 'cough'. There is overlap with 'fever', but the other negative findings are different. [RESULT]: 2"

    "21269586": {
        "living_situation": "[REASON]: The prediction accurately captures the patient's living situation as 'assisted living', which is consistent with the GT's 'Lives in assisted living facility'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "tobacco": "[REASON]: The prediction 'used to smoke, long time ago' is semantically equivalent to the GT's 'History of smoking; quit many years ago'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "alcohol": "[REASON]: The prediction 'used to drink a lot, stopped years ago' is semantically equivalent to the GT's 'History of heavy alcohol use; currently abstinent'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "allergies": "[REASON]: The prediction 'No known allergies' is semantically equivalent to the GT's 'No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction 'sister had heart attack' is semantically equivalent to the GT's 'Sister with MI' (Myocardial Infarction, which is a heart attack). [RESULT]: 4",
        "medical_device": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Not recorded', while the prediction mentions 'wheelchair'. The wheelchair is mentioned in the present illness section of the GT, but not explicitly listed as a medical device in the GT's medical_device field. Therefore, the prediction is incorrect for this specific field. [RESULT]: 1",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction 'high blood pressure; maybe heart issues' only captures a small portion of the extensive medical history listed in the GT (Paroxysmal Afib, Anemia of chronic disease, Alcoholic Cirrhosis, ESRD on hemodialysis, C. diff infection, COPD, Dehydration, Diarrhea, HTN, Umbilical hernia). [RESULT]: 2",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: Both the GT and the prediction identify 'Chest pain' as the chief complaint. [RESULT]: 4",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The GT indicates '0' for pain, while the prediction states '7 or 8 (earlier), gone now'. The prediction reflects the transient nature of the pain mentioned in the present illness section of the GT, but the final state of 'gone now' aligns with the GT's '0'. However, the prediction includes the earlier pain score which is not in the GT's pain field. [RESULT]: 3",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction provides a very general description ('many pills, assisted living helps; maybe for heart issues; for high blood pressure') and does not list the specific medications provided in the GT. [RESULT]: 1",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction captures several key positive findings from the GT's present illness section, including chest pain, onset time, description of pain (band around chest, spread to arms and back), and shortness of breath. It misses other details like feeling terrible, pain occurring while sitting, improvement with O2 and nitroglycerin, DOE, 2 pillow orthopnea, and never having pain like this before. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction lists negative findings that are not present in the GT's present illness negative section (no previous episodes of chest pain or shortness of breath; no recent illnesses, hospitalizations, or surgeries; no recent changes in weight, appetite, or energy levels; mood stable). The GT lists denial of PND, swelling, fevers, chills, DVT/PE, and stroke/TIA. [RESULT]: 1"
    },
    "27334177": {
        "exercise": "[REASON]: The prediction captures the essence of limited activity due to current symptoms and the history of walking, although the phrasing is different. 'Used to walk; cannot do much with tummy issue' is semantically equivalent to 'Limited activity due to current symptoms; History of walking'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "tobacco": "[REASON]: The prediction 'Quit years ago' is a direct and accurate summary of the GT 'Former smoker; Quit several years ago'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "alcohol": "[REASON]: The prediction 'Glass or two of wine sometimes' accurately reflects the GT 'Occasional social drinker; Wine; 1-2 glasses per week'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "illicit_drug": "[REASON]: The prediction 'No drugs' is a clear and accurate representation of the GT 'Denies illicit drug use'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "allergies": "[REASON]: The prediction lists the correct medications and adds the reaction (rash), which is not in the GT but is a common detail included with allergies. The core information is present and accurate. [RESULT]: 4",
        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction accurately identifies the family members and their conditions, using slightly different but semantically equivalent terms ('Heart issues' for 'CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE'). [RESULT]: 4",
        "medical_device": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Not recorded', while the prediction lists 'Stent'. Based on the medical history (CAD s/p DES to RCA), a stent is present. The prediction is likely correct based on other information, but it contradicts the explicit statement in the GT for this specific key. However, given the context, the prediction is more informative and likely accurate based on the medical history provided elsewhere. Rating based on semantic equivalence and overall profile consistency. [RESULT]: 3",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction lists the key medical conditions mentioned in the GT, using simpler terms ('Heart issues (stent)' for 'CAD s/p DES to RCA', 'Mood issues' for 'Depression'). It misses HLD and obesity but captures the major points. [RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction 'Tummy trouble' is a simplified but reasonable summary of the chief complaints 'Abd pain, Nausea'. [RESULT]: 3",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The prediction provides the exact same numerical value for pain as the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists almost all medications from the GT. It includes 'Lorazepam (sometimes)', which is a slight variation but still indicates the medication is used. It misses none of the medications listed in the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction captures most of the positive symptoms and their characteristics mentioned in the GT, using slightly different phrasing. It includes abdominal pain, distention/gas, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, decreased appetite, and weight loss. It misses 'heaving' and 'pain with eating' but adds 'Tiredness'. Overall, it's a good summary. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction lists some of the negative symptoms from the GT (fever, chills). It replaces 'chest pain' and 'shortness of breath' with 'No heartburn' and 'No acid reflux', which are related but not the same. It misses many other negative symptoms listed in the GT. [RESULT]: 2"

        "illicit_drug": "[REASON]: The prediction 'No drugs' is semantically equivalent to 'Denies use'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "allergies": "[REASON]: The prediction mentions an allergy to a medicine causing cough, which aligns with the GT mentioning Lisinopril, a known cause of cough. However, the specific name is not mentioned in the prediction. [RESULT]: 3",
        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction mentions 'Mother had sugar', which is a partial match to the GT which denies strokes and seizures but doesn't mention diabetes. The GT is more specific about what is denied. [RESULT]: 2",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction mentions 'Stomach operation' and 'left eye operation'. The GT mentions 'left eye cataract repair' and 'hernia repair'. The left eye operation is a match, but the stomach operation is not explicitly mentioned in the GT's list of medical history items, although a hernia repair could be considered a stomach area operation. However, the prediction misses several key medical history items from the GT (HTN, CKD, Anemia, OSA, Elevated PSA, Prediabetic, Gout). [RESULT]: 2",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction mentions 'Dizzy' and 'arm feel funny'. The GT mentions 'Hypertension, Presyncope'. 'Dizzy' is related to 'Presyncope', and 'arm feel funny' relates to the transient sensory changes in the left arm mentioned in the present illness. It captures the core symptoms but not the hypertension. [RESULT]: 3",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction mentions 'Pills for pressure; other stuff (names not remembered)'. The GT lists specific medications including amlodipine and irbesartan, which are for blood pressure. The prediction is very general and does not list the specific medications. [RESULT]: 2",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction mentions 'Dizzy' and 'left arm feel funny (feel heavy, like stone, getting better now)'. The GT mentions 'dizziness', 'presyncope', 'transient sensory symptoms left arm (lasting 25 min to 1 hour)', and 'left hand felt heavy (improving ~25 min, normal within hour)'. The prediction captures the core positive symptoms of dizziness and the left arm sensation, including the heavy feeling and improvement. [RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction lists several denied symptoms like 'Headaches', 'chest pain', and 'shortness of breath', which are also denied in the GT. However, the prediction includes many general denied symptoms not present in the GT (e.g., changes in routine, energy, weight, mood, sleep, stress). It also misses several specific neurological denials from the GT (e.g., difficulty producing/comprehending speech, facial droop, lower extremity weakness). [RESULT]: 3"

    "29815513": {
        "tobacco": "[REASON]: The prediction accurately reflects that the patient denies tobacco use, although it omits the word 'tobacco'. Semantically equivalent. [RESULT]: 4",

It also includes 'chest feels bad' which is mentioned in the HPI but not the chief complaint in the GT. It misses 'Diarrhea' as a chief complaint. [RESULT]: 3",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The prediction provides a numerical value for pain (8), which is close to the GT value (10). [RESULT]: 3",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction provides a very general description of the medications (pills for sugar, heart, leg pain, hospital administered) and does not list the specific medications mentioned in the GT. [RESULT]: 2",

        "tobacco": "[REASON]: The prediction 'No smoke' is semantically equivalent to 'Does not use tobacco'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "alcohol": "[REASON]: The prediction 'Little, with friends' is a partial match for 'Drinks alcohol socially, typically 1-2 drinks per week'. It captures the social aspect and implies limited use but lacks the specific frequency. [RESULT]: 3",
        "illicit_drug": "[REASON]: The prediction 'No drugs' is semantically equivalent to 'Denies illicit drug use'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "allergies": "[REASON]: The prediction lists only a subset of the allergies mentioned in the GT. [RESULT]: 2",
        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction mentions maternal grandparents with heart problems, which is present in the GT, but misses other details. [RESULT]: 3",

        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction lists chest pain and difficulty breathing, which are related to the GT of 'PNEUMONIA' but not the exact chief complaint. [RESULT]: 2",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The GT states the current pain level is 0, while the prediction states it was 10 previously. This is a discrepancy in the current state. [RESULT]: 1",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction provides only vague descriptions of the medications and does not list the specific names provided in the GT. [RESULT]: 1",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction captures several positive symptoms mentioned in the GT, such as chest pain, difficulty breathing, and coughing, but also includes 'Tired' and 'Forgetful' which are not in the GT. It misses some specific details about the dyspnea. [RESULT]: 3",

        "allergies": "[REASON]: The prediction 'Sulfa' is the exact allergy listed in the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medical_device": "[REASON]: The GT lists 'G-tube currently to gravity' and 'PEG'. The prediction only lists 'PEG'. While PEG is mentioned in the GT's medical history, the primary medical device listed is the G-tube. The prediction is partially correct but misses the main device. [RESULT]: 3",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'colon removed', 'PEG', 'COPD', 'high blood pressure', and 'high cholesterol'. The GT lists 'COPD', 'etoh abuse', 'gerd', 'hld', 'htn', 'pulm nodule', 'SBO', 'UC', 'basal cell skin cancer', 'traumatic SAH', 'PEG', and 'total abdominal colectomy with ilioanal anastomosis'. 'Colon removed' is semantically equivalent to 'total abdominal colectomy with ilioanal anastomosis'. 'High blood pressure' is equivalent to 'htn'. 'High cholesterol' is equivalent to 'hld'. The prediction captures several key elements but misses others like UC, SBO, SAH, and basal cell skin cancer. [RESULT]: 3",

        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'Tylenol', 'bupropion', 'Keppra', and 'lorazepam'. The GT lists 'acetaminophen [Tylenol]', 'bupropion HCl', 'Keppra', and 'lorazepam'. The prediction accurately lists all the medications, using common names where applicable. [RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The GT lists specific positive findings related to the SBO and lack of BMs. The prediction lists abdominal pain characteristics, vomiting details, lack of bowel movements, and general symptoms like weight loss and tiredness. While there is overlap (abdominal pain, vomiting, no BMs), the details and focus differ. The prediction includes symptoms not explicitly listed as positive findings in the GT's present illness section. [RESULT]: 2",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The GT lists 'denies n/v (patient states); no fevers/chills; no dysuria'. The prediction lists 'no fever; no chills'.

        "tobacco": "[REASON]: The GT specifies 'smoking', and the prediction specifies 'cigarettes'. While 'cigarettes' is a type of smoking, 'smoking' is a broader term that encompasses other forms of tobacco use. However, in common medical context, 'smoking' often refers to cigarette smoking. The prediction is a specific example of the GT. [RESULT]: 3",
        "alcohol": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Occasional alcohol use reported', and the prediction states 'sometimes, not much'. Both indicate infrequent and limited alcohol consumption. The meaning is semantically equivalent. [RESULT]: 4",

Both mention opiates, but the prediction adds the detail that it's a past problem, which is not present in the GT. The core substance is mentioned, but the temporal aspect differs. [RESULT]: 3",
        "allergies": "[REASON]: The prediction lists most of the allergies mentioned in the GT (Aspirin, Sudafed, Toradol, Levaquin, Amitriptyline, Motrin, Ultram, latex tape). It omits 'acetaminophen' and uses 'contrast dye' instead of 'iv contrast', which is semantically equivalent. It also adds 'break out' for latex tape, which is a detail about the reaction. Overall, it captures the majority of the information accurately. [RESULT]: 3",

It misses several other details like remote PE, possible tracheobronchomalacia, personality traits, possible factitious disorder, insomnia, ? h/o of SBO, Diverticulitis, and gastroparesis. [RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT lists 'Abd pain, Chest pain'. The prediction lists 'terrible pain in stomach, side, and chest'. 'Stomach' and 'side' pain are consistent with abdominal pain, and 'chest' pain is explicitly mentioned. The prediction adds the descriptor 'terrible' and 'side', which are elaborations but the core complaints are present. [RESULT]: 4",

        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction includes several key elements from the GT (AML, transplant, stable AAA, degenerative disk disease) but omits details about the transplant complications, attention symptoms, right inguinal hernia, and tonsillectomy. It also includes 'URI symptoms for two months' which is more appropriately in the present illness section. [RESULT]: 3",

        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction includes most of the positive symptoms listed in the GT, although some are slightly rephrased. It misses 'diaphoresis' and the detail about the fall being slow and without trauma/LOC. It also includes 'congestion on and off for two months' which is a summary rather than a specific positive symptom. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction includes some of the negative symptoms from the GT (chills, loss of consciousness, injury from fall, difficulty breathing which is related to sob).

        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The GT lists specific conditions for the mother (MI, PVD, CAD). The prediction states 'Mother had heart problems; Mother had a stroke'. While 'heart problems' is a general term that could encompass MI, PVD, and CAD, 'had a stroke' is not explicitly mentioned in the GT for the mother. The prediction is partially correct but lacks the specificity of the GT and includes information not present in the GT. [RESULT]: 2",

The prediction only captures a small portion of the GT's medical history. [RESULT]: 2",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT states 'L Numbness'. The prediction states 'Left hand feels weak and strange'. While 'strange' could encompass numbness, 'weak' is also included and the primary focus is on the hand feeling 'weak and strange' rather than just numbness. It's related but not an exact match or direct semantic equivalent of just 'numbness'. [RESULT]: 2",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The GT states '0'. The prediction states '0'. This is an exact match. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The GT lists several medications. The prediction lists all the medications from the GT plus 'doxycycline (for tick bite)'.

The prediction uses slightly different phrasing but the meaning is consistent. [RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Not recorded'. The prediction provides several negative symptoms. Since the GT explicitly states it was not recorded, any prediction providing negative symptoms is inconsistent with the GT. [RESULT]: 1"

While tiredness and weakness are symptoms of ILI and are mentioned in the HPI, they are not explicitly listed as chief complaints in the GT. Fever is listed in both. [RESULT]: 3",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists most of the medications mentioned in the GT, some by their general purpose rather than specific name (e.g., 'Pill for bones' for alendronate, 'pill for thyroid' for levothyroxine, 'pill for mood' for citalopram, 'pill for stomach' for omeprazole, 'vitamins' for multivitamin and Calcium Magnesium + D, 'fish oil' for Omega-3 Fatty Acids). It correctly identifies aspirin, prednisone, lorazepam, and azithromycin. [RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction captures several key positive symptoms and their approximate onset/timing mentioned in the GT (tiredness, weakness, fever, throat tightness, cough with phlegm, SOB with shoveling, temperature 102.4). However, it adds symptoms related to sleep and daytime tiredness that are not explicitly stated in the GT's positive findings section, although they might be inferred from the overall description of feeling weak and tired. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction lists several negative findings. Only 'Denies shortness of breath with walking steps' is directly supported by the GT ('able to climb 3 flights of steps w/o difficulty'). The other negative findings listed in the prediction (denies constant fever, changes in appetite, weight change, rash, changes in skin, unusual bruising) are not mentioned in the GT's negative findings section.

However, it misses the ruptured ovarian cyst and is less specific. [RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction includes 'frequent urination', which is the primary chief complaint in the GT. It also includes 'burning sensation in toilet area', which is a symptom of dysuria mentioned in the present illness, but not explicitly the chief complaint. [RESULT]: 3",

        "allergies": "[REASON]: The prediction lists penicillins and lisinopril correctly. It also mentions 'other serious allergy (EpiPen)', which is related to the omalizumab allergy and the mention of EpiPen in the GT medications, but it doesn't explicitly state omalizumab or ACE Inhibitors as allergies. [RESULT]: 3",
        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction states 'no major illnesses running in the family; parents healthy', which is a more detailed way of saying 'Non-contributory'. It conveys the same meaning. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medical_device": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Not recorded', while the prediction lists 'EpiPen'. The EpiPen is listed under medications in the GT, and while it is a medical device, the GT explicitly says 'Not recorded' for the medical device section. This is a discrepancy. [RESULT]: 1",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'pancreas problems; pancreatectomy; gallbladder removed; reflux'. This covers pancreatitis, central pancreatectomy, open cholecystectomy, and gastroesophageal reflux disease mentioned in the GT.

        "tobacco": "[REASON]: The prediction accurately reflects the GT regarding former smoking status, type of tobacco, frequency, and duration since quitting. 'used to smoke a pipe, one a day, quit years ago' is semantically equivalent to 'former smoker, 1 pipe/day, quit years ago'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "alcohol": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Not recorded', while the prediction states 'don't really drink'. These are not consistent. 'Not recorded' implies no information was available, whereas 'don't really drink' provides information about alcohol consumption. [RESULT]: 1",

        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The GT states 'No Family History currently on file'. The prediction states 'family is fine; don't know about their eyes'. The prediction provides some information about the family's health, which contradicts the GT's statement of no history on file. [RESULT]: 1",
        "medical_device": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Not recorded', meaning no information about medical devices was available. The prediction states 'glasses for reading', providing information about a medical device. These are inconsistent. [RESULT]: 1",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction includes several conditions mentioned in the GT (HSV, high cholesterol/hyperlipidemia, shaky hands/benign essential tremor, kidney stones/nephrolithiases, diarrhea). However, it misses Hepatitis B carrier and hx Blastocystis homini/Entamoeba histolytica. It also simplifies the descriptions (e.g., 'shaky hands' instead of 'benign essential tremor (controlled on zonisamide and propranolol)'). It captures most of the key conditions but is not exhaustive or as detailed as the GT. [RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Visual changes'. The prediction lists several symptoms including 'fuzzy vision', 'feel like falling over', 'walking is off', and 'feel lightheaded'. While 'fuzzy vision' relates to visual changes, the prediction includes other symptoms that are part of the present illness but not the chief complaint as stated in the GT. [RESULT]: 2",

The GT lists acyclovir, Zonegran (which is zonisamide), atorvastatin, nitroglycerin, propranolol, and aspirin. The medications listed are the same, with Zonegran being the brand name for zonisamide. [RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction includes 'fuzzy vision; things not in focus' (vision off; images blurred or out of focus), 'started today' (acute onset), 'feel like falling over', 'walking is off' (unsteady gait), 'feel lightheaded', 'feel unwell' (acute onset feeling unwell). It misses 'unbalanced' and 'disoriented'. It adds 'low energy' which is not in the GT. It captures most of the key positive symptoms. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The GT lists 'no known hypertension' and 'never fell'. The prediction lists a large number of negative symptoms, none of which are present in the GT. The prediction is completely different from the GT. [RESULT]: 1"

        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction 'Weakness' only includes one of the three chief complaints listed in the GT ('Chest pain, Nausea, Weakness'). [RESULT]: 2",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The prediction provides a numerical value for pain ('3 (predicted)') which is different from the GT's numerical value ('4'). While both are numerical representations of pain, they are not the same value. [RESULT]: 2",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction 'Some pills (for diabetes, maybe something else)' is very vague and only mentions medication for diabetes, missing the specific medications listed in the GT. [RESULT]: 1",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction provides a more detailed description of the weakness, including duration and impact, which aligns with and expands upon the GT's mention of weakness and unsteadiness. It also includes chest pressure and tiredness, which are not explicitly in the GT's positive findings but are related to the chief complaint. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction lists several specific negative findings, while the GT provides a general statement about a 'full 10 point review of systems otherwise negative'.

        "tobacco": "[REASON]: Both the GT and prediction indicate the patient is a past smoker who quit many years ago. [RESULT]: 4",
        "alcohol": "[REASON]: The GT states the patient rarely consumes alcohol. The prediction mentions drinking a little sometimes (holidays), which is consistent with rare consumption. [RESULT]: 4",
        "illicit_drug": "[REASON]: The GT states none reported, and the prediction states denies use, which are semantically equivalent. [RESULT]: 4",
        "allergies": "[REASON]: Both the GT and prediction list Penicillins/Penicillin and Amoxicillin as allergies. The prediction adds the reaction (rash), which is additional detail but doesn't contradict the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The GT states no known cardiac disease. The prediction mentions the mother had high blood pressure and the father had health problems (not heart disease), which supports the GT's statement about no known cardiac disease. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction lists several conditions that are present in the GT, including high blood pressure (HTN), previous heart attack (CAD s/p NSTEMI), heart failure (HFpEF), pulmonary hypertension, osteoarthritis (knees), colon polyp, anemia (iron deficiency), skin cancer (BCC on R cheek), and breast cancer.

[RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT lists chest pain. The prediction lists chest pressure and jaw pain. Chest pressure is a type of chest pain, and jaw pain is also mentioned in the positive symptoms in the GT. The prediction is partially correct but includes an additional chief complaint not explicitly stated as the primary one in the GT. [RESULT]: 3",
        "pain": "[REASON]: Both the GT and prediction state the pain score is 0. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists several medications that are present in the GT (Amlodipine, Metoprolol, Furosemide, Aspirin, Simvastatin, Omeprazole, Iron pills/ferrous sulfate, Melatonin). It also includes medication for pulmonary hypertension and constipation, which are likely related to conditions in the GT but not explicitly named. It misses Vitamin B-12, multivitamin, and docusate sodium (though medication for constipation is mentioned). Overall, it captures most of the key medications. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction includes chest pressure (with onset time and description), jaw pain (right side, constant, bothersome), and feeling like indigestion, all of which are present in the GT's positive symptoms. It misses the detail about receiving aspirin prior to arrival and the statement about never having a similar feeling. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction lists no shortness of breath, no sweating, no nausea, and no change in pressure or jaw discomfort. The GT lists dyspnea (shortness of breath), arm pain, nausea, cough, fever, new edema, and symptoms yesterday. The prediction captures the absence of shortness of breath and nausea but misses several other negative findings from the GT. [RESULT]: 2"

It is a reasonable summary of the main issues. [RESULT]: 3",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists the exact same medications as the GT, with only minor differences in capitalization. [RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction includes several key positive findings from the GT (lightheadedness, vision going dark bilateral, generalized weakness, episode of diarrhea earlier this AM). It also adds some additional details and elaborations that are consistent with the overall clinical picture but not explicitly stated in the GT's positive findings list (e.g., lightheadedness and vision changes are more recent, lightheadedness is more of a feeling like might faint, low energy levels). It misses the specific detail about being 'unable to sense bright vs dark (usually can)'. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction lists several negative findings. While some are related to the chief complaint (no headaches, no nausea, no spinning sensation, no recent falls), they are not the exact negative findings listed in the GT (fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, difficulty speaking, falls). The prediction includes 'no nausea' and 'no recent falls', which are present in the GT, but misses the others and adds several new ones. [RESULT]: 2"

[RESULT]: 2",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction lists several medical conditions that are present in the GT, although it uses less formal language and misses some details (e.g., specific types of cancer, bacteremia). It captures the essence of several key conditions. [RESULT]: 3",

This aligns well with the GT's mentions of 'mother on cardiac meds', 'father had stents', and 'father has DM'. The prediction's mention of the sister having 'something (forget)' is a vague representation of the GT's 'sister HIV positive'. Overall, the key elements are present, although some details are less specific in the prediction. [RESULT]: 3",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'high blood pressure; high cholesterol (maybe); diabetes; liver issue (think); eye issue (can't see well in one)'.

This is a very general description compared to the GT which lists specific medications: 'lisinopril' (blood pressure), 'etravirine, lamivudine, raltegravir' (HIV/AIDS, related to 'pills for sugar' in a broader sense due to the patient's complex medical history including diabetes), and 'azelastine, loratadine' (allergies). The prediction only captures the general categories of some medications and misses many others listed in the GT. [RESULT]: 2",

The GT mentions 'left upper arm pain (woke from sleep, persisted into morning); chest discomfort (progressed from arm pain); similar chest pain episode (8 months ago while walking)'. The prediction captures the onset and location of the pain and adds descriptive qualities (heavy weight, squeezing, etc.) and the feeling of impending doom, which are not in the GT. It misses the detail about the prior similar episode. While it adds detail, it doesn't fully align with the specific positive findings listed in the GT. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'no shortness of breath; no sweating; no nausea; no lightheadedness'. The GT lists 'SOB; diaphoresis; nausea; vomiting'. The prediction correctly identifies the absence of SOB and nausea. It uses 'no sweating' which is semantically equivalent to the absence of 'diaphoresis'. However, it includes 'no lightheadedness' which is not mentioned in the GT, and misses the absence of 'vomiting'. It is mostly correct but not a perfect match. [RESULT]: 3"

The prediction lists specific denied symptoms (fever, nausea, vomiting, changes in bowel habits, recent falls or near-falls). While 'fever' is consistent, the prediction provides more specific denials than the general statement in the GT. It doesn't fully capture the breadth of the GT's denial of other ROS symptoms.
