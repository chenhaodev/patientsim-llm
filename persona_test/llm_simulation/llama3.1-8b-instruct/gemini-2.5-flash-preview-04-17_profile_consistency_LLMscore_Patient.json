        "living_situation": "[REASON]: The prediction 'living on the streets' is semantically equivalent to the GT 'Homelessness'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "tobacco": "[REASON]: The prediction 'cigarettes' is consistent with the GT 'Cigarettes'. The GT includes additional information about amount and frequency, which is not present in the prediction, but the core information about cigarette use is captured. [RESULT]: 3",
        "alcohol": "[REASON]: The GT indicates active alcoholism and intoxication. The prediction mentions past struggles and trying to stay sober, which contradicts the GT's description of the current state. [RESULT]: 1",
        "illicit_drug": "[REASON]: The prediction 'denies recreational drugs' is semantically equivalent to the GT 'No reported illicit drug use'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "allergies": "[REASON]: The GT states 'No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions'. The prediction 'denies severe reactions; not entirely sure' is partially consistent in that it denies severe reactions, but the uncertainty introduces a discrepancy. [RESULT]: 3",
        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The GT specifically mentions 'No family history of respiratory issues'. The prediction mentions 'mom had some issues with her heart', which is a different medical history and does not address the respiratory history mentioned in the GT. [RESULT]: 1",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction mentions 'high blood pressure; something about heart; arthritis; osteoporosis'. This aligns with the GT's mention of 'HTN; Arthritis; Osteoporosis'. The GT also includes 'Alcoholism with history of severe withdrawal syndrome (seizures and DTs)' and '?Optic neuritis', which are not fully captured in the prediction, although 'something about heart' could vaguely relate to the carvedilol mentioned in medications. [RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT lists 'ETOH, ILI'. The prediction lists 'belly pain; cough; cold symptoms'. While cough and cold symptoms (ILI) are mentioned in both, the prediction includes belly pain which is not in the GT's chief complaint, and the GT includes ETOH (alcohol intoxication) which is not in the prediction's chief complaint. [RESULT]: 2",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The GT states the pain level is 0. The prediction states the pain level is 8-9. These are completely different values. [RESULT]: 1",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'lisinopril; carvedilol', which is an exact match to the medications listed in the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The GT mentions 'found down intoxicated; complained of cough and cold symptoms x2 weeks; quite tachycardic on presentation; upper belly hurts'. The prediction mentions 'belly pain; cough; cold symptoms; two weeks duration; upper belly pain; dull ache; radiating pain; burning sensation; dull throbbing pain; pain subsides when lying down; pain worse with movement or sitting up; mild nausea; constant queasiness; loss of appetite; loose stools; unpredictable bowel movements; feverish episodes; chills; night sweats; exposed to germs and illnesses from living on the streets; around someone sick a few weeks ago'. The prediction includes the cough, cold symptoms, duration, and upper belly pain mentioned in the GT, but adds significantly more detail about the pain characteristics and other symptoms not present in the GT's positive findings. It also misses 'found down intoxicated' and 'quite tachycardic on presentation'. [RESULT]: 2",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Not recorded'. The prediction provides specific negative findings ('denies vomiting; denies diarrhea; denies constipation'). Since the GT explicitly states no negative findings were recorded, the prediction is inconsistent. [RESULT]: 1"
    },
    "29114252": {
        "living_situation": "[REASON]: The prediction states 'new house' which is not the same as 'Lives alone'. [RESULT]: 1",
        "exercise": "[REASON]: The prediction mentions 'daily walks; light stretching' which is consistent with 'Walks daily; Light stretching 3x/week'. The frequency of stretching is slightly less specific but the core activities are present. [RESULT]: 4",
        "tobacco": "[REASON]: Both the GT and prediction state 'Non-smoker' and 'non-smoker' respectively. [RESULT]: 4",
        "alcohol": "[REASON]: The prediction mentions 'occasional glass of wine with dinner; once or twice a week' which is consistent with 'Occasional social drinking; Wine 1-2 glasses per week'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "illicit_drug": "[REASON]: The prediction states 'denies use' which is semantically equivalent to 'No known illicit drug use'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "allergies": "[REASON]: Both the GT and prediction state 'Doxycycline' and 'doxycycline' respectively. [RESULT]: 4",
        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The GT states 'No history of stroke', while the prediction mentions 'mom had vision problems (age-related)'. These are different pieces of information. [RESULT]: 1",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction includes 'breast cancer (in remission)' and 'gout', which are present in the GT. However, it misses 'branch retinal vein occlusion left eye s/p focal laser photocoagulation' and 'presumed DVT, initially on warfarin, warfarin discontinued'. It also adds 'high blood pressure' which is not in the GT. [RESULT]: 2",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Visual changes' and the prediction states 'double vision'. Double vision is a type of visual change, so it's partially correct but not the full scope of the GT. [RESULT]: 3",
        "pain": "[REASON]: Both the GT and prediction indicate no pain (0). [RESULT]: 4",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'lisinopril; allopurinol; Centrum Women; Vitamin D3', which is the exact same list as the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction mentions 'double vision (lasted a few minutes; went away when eyes closed)' and 'left eye felt tired after double vision episode'. The GT provides more detail about the onset and nature of the diplopia ('acute onset binocular diplopia; woke 05AM seeing fine; woke 6AM seeing double; significant horizontal diplopia; resolved with eye closure; no acuity deficits'). The prediction captures the core symptom and resolution with eye closure but misses other details. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Not recorded', while the prediction lists several negative symptoms. These are completely different. [RESULT]: 1"

        "marital_status": "[REASON]: The prediction 'Married' is semantically equivalent to the GT 'MARRIED'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "living_situation": "[REASON]: The prediction 'Lives with wife' is semantically equivalent to the GT 'Lives with spouse', assuming the spouse is the wife. [RESULT]: 4",
        "exercise": "[REASON]: The prediction 'Walks' is a specific type of exercise, but the GT indicates limited activity due to health conditions, which is a broader description of the patient's exercise capacity. The prediction is not fully consistent with the GT's emphasis on limitation. [RESULT]: 2",
        "tobacco": "[REASON]: The prediction 'Quit many years ago' is consistent with the GT 'Former smoker; quit many years ago'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "alcohol": "[REASON]: The prediction 'Little bit of wine' is a specific example of occasional social use, which is consistent with the GT 'Occasional social use; infrequent'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "illicit_drug": "[REASON]: The prediction 'Denies use' is consistent with the GT 'Denies illicit drug use'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "allergies": "[REASON]: The prediction lists the same allergies as the GT, just in a different order. [RESULT]: 4",
        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction includes the key family history items mentioned in the GT (Sister: lung cancer, breast cancer; Mother: diabetes, stroke). It also adds that the family members are deceased, which is not in the GT but doesn't contradict it. It misses the detail about no family history of melanoma. [RESULT]: 3",
        "medical_device": "[REASON]: The prediction mentions 'Stents (15 years ago)', which is a medical device present in the patient's history (mentioned in the medical history section of the GT). The GT states 'Not recorded' for medical device, which seems incorrect given the medical history. However, evaluating consistency between the GT and Prediction, the Prediction provides a relevant medical device while the GT states it's not recorded. This makes direct comparison difficult, but the prediction is providing information that is present elsewhere in the GT. [RESULT]: 3",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction captures the major medical history items from the GT (Melanoma spread to lungs, Diabetes, Heart surgery including bypass and stents, Thyroid condition, High cholesterol, Prostate issues). It misses some details like CAD s/p 3 vessel bypass surgery specifically, multiple coronary stents, Carotid artery disease s/p carotid endarterectomy, Spinal stenosis s/p laminectomy, Hearing loss, No history of PUD, Hypoglycemia (one week ago), and Generalized fatigue c/w adrenal insufficiency. However, it covers the most significant conditions. [RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction 'Low blood pressure; Feeling sick' captures the core of the GT 'HYPOTENSIVE', as hypotension means low blood pressure, and feeling sick is a reasonable interpretation of the patient's overall state given the hypotension and fever. [RESULT]: 4",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The GT states '0' for pain. The prediction states '2 (predicted)'. These are inconsistent. [RESULT]: 1",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists almost all the medications from the GT, missing only Plavix. The order is different, but the list is largely consistent. [RESULT]: 3",
        "arrival_transport": "[REASON]: The prediction 'Ambulance' is consistent with the GT 'AMBULANCE'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction includes hypotension (blood pressure drop low), dizziness (related to orthostasis), tiredness (generalized fatigue), chest discomfort, stomach discomfort (abdominal discomfort), and feverish (febrile). It misses the specific BP value (92/50), the rectal temp (102.1F), the description of chest/abdominal discomfort as 'indigestion' and lasting for minutes, and the hypoglycemia with FSBG value. It adds 'Fast heart beat' which is not explicitly in the GT's positive findings but could be related to hypotension. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction 'Shortness of breath; Significant pain' is largely consistent with the GT 'Denies SOB; Denies palpitations'. It replaces 'palpitations' with 'Significant pain', which is a different negative finding. [RESULT]: 3"

        "illicit_drug": "[REASON]: The prediction accurately states that the patient denies illicit drug use using semantically equivalent phrasing. [RESULT]: 4",
        "allergies": "[REASON]: The prediction accurately states that the patient denies known allergies, which is semantically equivalent to 'No Known Allergies'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction provides specific details about family history (grandma and mom with digestive issues) which contradicts the GT's statement of \"Non-contributory\". [RESULT]: 1",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction mentions some relevant medical history items (digestive system issues, bowel problems, end-ileostomy, J-pouch) but misses several key diagnoses and procedures listed in the GT (Hemorrhoids, Ulcerative Colitis, Axillary abscesses, C. diff infection, TAC, Laparotomy, LOA, proctectomy, ileal J-pouch to anal anastomosis w temporary loop ileostomy, takedown of ileostomy). [RESULT]: 2",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction accurately identifies the chief complaint as abdominal pain. [RESULT]: 4",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The prediction provides a numerical value for pain, but it is different from the GT's value. [RESULT]: 3",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists the exact same medications as the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction includes several positive findings mentioned in the GT (constant cramping abdominal pain, suprapubic and LUQ pain, chills, sweats, bloody streaks on toilet paper, nausea, vomiting) but also includes additional details not present in the GT (sharp stabbing pain, pain feels like tightening knot, urgency, mucus, acidic/sour taste, cold sweats, feeling weak, tired, hungry, difficulty eating). It also misses the duration of nausea (24hrs) and the onset related to eating potato chips. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction lists some negative findings, but they are different from the negative findings listed in the GT (denies hematemesis, fevers, gross blood, blood in stool since pain began). The prediction lists diarrhea, constipation, solid bowel movements, fever, and weight loss as negative findings. [RESULT]: 1"

        "exercise": "[REASON]: The prediction 'light walking; stretching a few times a week' captures the essence of 'Occasional light walking several times per week; Stretching'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "tobacco": "[REASON]: The prediction 'denies' is a semantically equivalent way to state 'Never used tobacco' in the context of a medical profile. [RESULT]: 4",

        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction includes Hypertension, fall, and intermittent numbness, but misses HLD, GERD, Insomnia, Constipation, and the specific location and duration of the fall and subsequent pain. [RESULT]: 2",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction includes 'strange sensation in left arm and head', 'warm, tingling feeling in left arm', 'pressure on left side of head', and 'numbness in left arm', which are more detailed than the GT's 'Hypertension, L Arm numbness'. While it captures the arm numbness, it misses hypertension as a chief complaint and adds other sensations. [RESULT]: 3",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The GT explicitly states '0' for pain, while the prediction provides a predicted range ('2 or 3 (predicted)'). This is a significant difference in the reported pain level. [RESULT]: 1",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'felodipine; lisinopril; omeprazole; melatonin', which are present in the GT, but misses 'nystatin', 'sucralfate', and 'verapamil'. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction captures the onset time, location of sensation, type of sensation (warm, tingling, pressure), improvement level, and history of similar symptoms. It misses the 'Last known well last night', 'Slightly difficult walking due to sensation', and 'Current symptoms feel different than past sensory changes with pain'. It also includes some less relevant details like 'feeling a bit off', 'weird few months', and 'feeling a bit stressful'. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction 'denies recent changes in vision, speech, or balance; denies significant stress, weight changes, or fatigue in past few months' is completely different from the GT's 'Denies feeling weak; Denies symptoms on right side of body'.

        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'Gastric bypass surgery; heart issues; thyroid issues; heartburn'. The GT lists 'hypothyroidism; HTN; CAD s/p stent; gastric bypass'. The prediction captures gastric bypass, thyroid issues (hypothyroidism), and heart issues (HTN, CAD s/p stent), but adds heartburn which is not in the GT. It misses the specific conditions within 'heart issues'. [RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction 'Stomach pain' is a simplified version of the GT 'Abd pain, SBO'. It captures the pain but misses the potential cause (SBO). [RESULT]: 3",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The GT provides a numerical value (0), while the prediction provides a numerical value with a descriptor ('7 (predicted)'). The values are different, and the prediction includes a descriptor not present in the GT. [RESULT]: 1",

The GT lists 'worsening abdominal pain; abdominal pain started while eating lunch yesterday; located in epigastric area; sharp; nonradiating; intermittent but worse each time it returns; emesis w/ PO contrast'. Both mention epigastric pain, sharp pain, and onset after eating yesterday. The prediction adds details about difficulty eating and feeling of blockage/bursting, while the GT mentions worsening, nonradiating, intermittent nature, and emesis with contrast. There is overlap but also significant differences in the details captured. [RESULT]: 2",

        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction 'Father died suddenly; Mother had cancer' captures the key information from the GT 'father passed away in sleep; mother died of cancer' and the implication of sudden death. It misses the detail about no premature coronary artery disease or sudden death in general, but the core information about the parents is present. [RESULT]: 3",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction 'Takes medicine for heart; Doctor told him he has something with his heart' is a very vague summary compared to the specific diagnoses in the GT 'Nonobstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy; history of nonsustained Ventricular Tachycardia'. It only captures that there is a heart issue. [RESULT]: 2",

        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction 'Aspirin (every now and then); Atenolol; Something else for heart' lists the two medications from the GT 'Aspirin, Atenolol' and adds a vague 'Something else for heart'. The inclusion of the two specific medications makes it partially correct. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction captures several key positive findings from the GT, such as chest pressure/tightness yesterday, lightheadedness, diaphoresis, symptoms resolving when lying down, symptoms lasting all day, and symptoms resolving this morning. It misses some details like the time of onset, radiation, association with OJ, the 13-hour flight, and the initial ED vitals. However, it captures the main symptomatic timeline and associated symptoms. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction lists several negative findings, some of which are not explicitly mentioned in the GT (e.g., changes in mood, sleep, diet, swelling in legs). It does capture the denial of similar symptoms in the past, which is in the GT ('no history of similar episode'). It misses other negative findings from the GT like no choking, no fevers/vomiting/diarrhea/headache/vision change before ED, no history PE/DVT/surgery/trauma/smoking, and no chest pain on admission. Due to the inclusion of some irrelevant negatives and missing several relevant ones, the consistency is partial. [RESULT]: 2"

        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction lists several items from the GT's medical history (recurrent UTIs, obstructive uropathy, kidney cancer s/p nephrectomy, BPH, T2DM, COPD, anxiety). However, it misses several other conditions listed in the GT (bladder mets, pyelonephritis, HTN, HLD, GERD, depression, CAD, sternal CP). It also includes 'fluid retention' and 'constipation' which are not explicitly listed as diagnoses in the GT's medical history, although constipation is mentioned in the positive symptoms. [RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'right flank pain; back pain; groin pain' as the chief complaint. The GT lists 'R Flank pain'. While the prediction includes related pain locations, the primary chief complaint in the GT is just R Flank pain. [RESULT]: 3",

        "medical_device": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Not recorded', while the prediction mentions 'wheelchair'. The wheelchair is mentioned in the present illness section of the GT, not as a medical device in the medical history. Therefore, the prediction is incorrect in this context. [RESULT]: 1",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction lists some conditions present in the GT (Afib, high blood pressure, COPD, dialysis) but misses several others (Anemia of chronic disease, Alcoholic Cirrhosis, C. diff infection, Dehydration, Diarrhea, Umbilical hernia). It also includes 'heart problems' which is too general. [RESULT]: 2",

        "medical_device": "[REASON]: The prediction 'stent' is a specific type of medical device related to the patient's history of CAD s/p DES, which is not explicitly mentioned as a current device in the GT. The GT states 'Not recorded'. While the patient likely has a stent, the GT explicitly says it's not recorded. Therefore, the prediction is not consistent with the GT's statement. [RESULT]: 1",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction 'heart attack a few years ago; stent placement; high blood pressure; high cholesterol; appendectomy when younger' covers most of the key points in the GT 'CAD s/p DES to RCA; HTN; HLD; obesity; Depression; s/p Appendectomy', missing only obesity and depression. The phrasing is different but semantically similar for the included items. [RESULT]: 3",

It misses Lorazepam, omeprazole, ondansetron, and sertraline. [RESULT]: 2",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction captures many of the positive symptoms mentioned in the GT, such as abdominal pain (location, duration, character, relief), nausea, vomiting, weight loss, pain with eating, and diarrhea.

However, it misses several other significant medical history items from the GT (CKD, Anemia, OSA, Elevated PSA, Prediabetic, left eye cataract repair, hernia repair). [RESULT]: 2",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'Dizzy', 'Fell down', and 'Left arm feel heavy'. The GT lists 'Hypertension' and 'Presyncope'. While dizziness and falling are related to presyncope, 'Hypertension' is a key chief complaint in the GT that is missing from the prediction. The prediction also includes 'Fell down' and 'Left arm feel heavy' which are more details of the present illness rather than the primary chief complaints. [RESULT]: 2",

        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists Insulin, Acetaminophen, and Amlodipine, which are present in the GT. It also mentions 'Pills for blood pressure' and 'Pills for blood sugar', which are general descriptions that likely correspond to other medications in the GT (e.g., amlodipine for blood pressure, and potentially others for blood sugar besides insulin). However, it misses several specific medications listed in the GT. [RESULT]: 2",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction mentions chest pain (left side, severe), arm pain (left side), and nausea/sick to stomach, which are consistent with the GT. It also includes details about the pain being better when lying down and returning when getting up, and mentions the heart racing/beating fast, which are not explicitly in the GT's positive findings but could be related symptoms. The GT mentions the pain duration and resolution, which are not in the prediction. Overall, there is overlap but also differences in the specific details captured. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction denies shortness of breath, which is consistent with the GT's denial of dyspnea. The prediction also denies dizziness and sweating, which are not explicitly listed in the GT's negative findings. The GT denies palpitations and anaphylaxis, which are not in the prediction.

        "alcohol": "[REASON]: The ground truth states 'Not recorded', while the prediction provides information about past alcohol use. These are different as one indicates no information was recorded, and the other provides specific details about alcohol use. They are not consistent.\n[RESULT]: 1",

        "pain": "[REASON]: The ground truth states the pain level is 6. The prediction states the pain level is '6-8'. While 6 is included in the range, the prediction provides a range rather than a single value, making it partially correct.\n[RESULT]: 3",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction includes 'calcium', 'doxycycline', 'Fluvoxamine', 'Rilutek', and 'Zolpidem', which are present in the ground truth (allowing for variations in naming like 'calcium carbonate-vitamin D3' being represented as 'calcium' and 'vitamins', and 'riluzole [Rilutek]' being represented as 'Rilutek'). However, it omits 'lisinopril' and adds 'Aspirin'. It is partially correct.\n[RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction includes 'Chest pain', 'pain radiates to back', 'weakness', 'difficulty walking', and 'constipation', which are present in the ground truth. However, it omits details about the pain onset, straining for BM, left sided pressure, progressively weak, walk no more than yards, took 81 mg ASA x4, ambulation difficult task given extremity weakness, and weakness especially with walking.

        "tobacco": "[REASON]: The prediction states the patient smokes and provides an amount, which is more specific than the GT. However, the GT states 'Reports current tobacco use; type and amount not specified', implying the patient reported current use but didn't specify the details. The prediction provides details not present in the GT. Therefore, it's partially correct in stating current use but adds unverified details.\n[RESULT]: 3",
        "alcohol": "[REASON]: The GT states 'History of alcohol abuse; current status not specified'. The prediction states 'sober for a while'. This aligns with a history of abuse and suggests current sobriety, which is a plausible interpretation of 'current status not specified' but not explicitly stated in the GT.\n[RESULT]: 3",
        "illicit_drug": "[REASON]: The GT states 'History of polysubstance abuse including cocaine; current status not specified'. The prediction states 'clean for a while'. This aligns with a history of abuse and suggests current abstinence, which is a plausible interpretation of 'current status not specified' but not explicitly stated in the GT.\n[RESULT]: 3",
        "allergies": "[REASON]: The prediction lists all the allergies mentioned in the GT with slightly different phrasing for Sulfa (Sulfa antibiotics vs Sulfonamide Antibiotics) and lactose (lactose intolerance vs lactose). The meaning is the same.\n[RESULT]: 4",
        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The GT lists specific conditions denied (cancer, HTN, chronic lung diseases). The prediction gives a more general statement denying heart disease or lung conditions. While related, it doesn't cover all the specific denials in the GT.\n[RESULT]: 2",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction lists some of the conditions from the GT (HIV, back pain, joint pain, pneumonia, depression) but misses several others (HTN, gout, Prior PE, Traumatic brain injury, Left pupillary tear/blind in left eye, History of polysubstance abuse, H/o suicide attempts, multiple Psychiatric hospitalizations).\n[RESULT]: 2",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT lists 'Dyspnea, Productive cough'. The prediction lists 'chest pain; trouble breathing'. 'Trouble breathing' is semantically equivalent to 'Dyspnea'. However, the prediction includes 'chest pain' which is not listed as a chief complaint in the GT, and misses 'Productive cough'.\n[RESULT]: 2",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The GT explicitly states the pain level is 0. The prediction provides a predicted pain level of 3. These are completely different values.\n[RESULT]: 1",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists all the medications mentioned in the GT (Norvir, Truvada, amlodipine, gabapentin, Reyataz) and adds 'medication for depression', which is not explicitly listed in the GT but is plausible given the history of depression. However, the core medications from the GT are present.\n[RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction captures the key positive symptoms from the GT (chest pain details, trouble breathing/SOB) with similar descriptions. It misses the back pain and joint pain details which are also listed under positive symptoms in the GT.\n[RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The GT lists specific denials related to the chief complaint and present illness (stomach pain, acid reflux, trauma, cough, fevers, nasal congestion). The prediction lists a different set of denials, some of which are not mentioned in the GT (sweating, nausea, dizziness, recent weight loss, changes in appetite, recent stressors, increased anxiety, recent exposure to respiratory infections). It only partially overlaps with the GT's denials (stomach issues vs stomach pain, radiating pain vs no radiation for chest pain).\n[RESULT]: 2"

It misses OSA and Colonic Adenoma but adds Asthma, which is not in the GT. It is partially correct but also includes incorrect information. [RESULT]: 2",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction includes fever, chills, and body aches, which are the main components of the GT's chief complaint (Fever, ILI, Body aches, where ILI implies fever/chills/body aches). It adds sore throat, which is not in the GT chief complaint but is in the positive symptoms. The core chief complaint is captured. [RESULT]: 3",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The GT provides a pain score of 2. The prediction provides a pain score of 7. These are significantly different. [RESULT]: 1",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction includes many medications from the GT (acyclovir, fluticasone, valsartan, multivitamin, Omega-3 Fatty Acids, ProAir HFA, ammonium lactate, ciclopirox, tretinoin, calcium, vitamin D, urea). It misses Calcium 500 + D as a single item but lists Calcium and Vitamin D separately, which is acceptable. It adds ibuprofen and cough syrup, which are not in the GT. Overall, it captures most of the GT medications but includes extra ones. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction includes fevers, chills, body aches, and cough, which are in the GT. It adds several other symptoms (sore throat, dry cough, chest tightness, shortness of breath with exertion, headache, body feels heavy, feeling down, worried about health) that are not in the GT positive symptoms. It captures the GT positive symptoms but includes many additional ones. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The GT lists numerous negative symptoms. The prediction only lists 'runny nose'. This is a very small subset of the GT negative symptoms. [RESULT]: 2"

        "tobacco": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Tobacco abuse', while the prediction says 'quit smoking a long time ago'. These are contradictory statements regarding current tobacco use. [RESULT]: 1",
        "alcohol": "[REASON]: Both the GT and prediction state 'Denies alcohol use'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "allergies": "[REASON]: Both the GT and prediction list 'sulfa' (or sulfonamide antibiotics) and 'bacitracin'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Mother died of MI', and the prediction states 'mother had a heart attack'. MI is a heart attack, so these are semantically equivalent. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medical_device": "[REASON]: The GT lists '2L supplemental oxygen only at night; Cane (occasional use); Walker'. The prediction lists 'walker; cane; inhaler; oxygen at night'. The prediction includes 'inhaler' which is not in the GT, and misses the '2L supplemental' detail for oxygen. It captures the main devices but adds an incorrect one. [RESULT]: 3",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The GT lists many conditions. The prediction lists 'COPD; high blood pressure; heart problems (heart not pumping right); edema in legs'. It captures COPD, HTN (high blood pressure), and B/l lower extremity edema (edema in legs). 'heart problems (heart not pumping right)' is a vague description that might relate to Mitral regurgitation, but it misses many other conditions listed in the GT. [RESULT]: 2",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT lists 'Nausea, Weakness'. The prediction lists 'back pain; vomiting; weakness; coughing; shortness of breath'. The prediction includes 'vomiting' which is related to nausea, and 'weakness'. However, it adds several other complaints not listed as the chief complaint in the GT. [RESULT]: 2",

The prediction lists some overlapping symptoms (vomiting, weakness, coughing, shortness of breath, leg swelling, waking up at night to urinate, memory issues) but also includes 'back hurts terribly from lifting walker' and 'feeling a bit down recently' which are not in the GT. It misses many specific details and includes some incorrect ones. [RESULT]: 2",

It misses some details from the GT regarding the timeline and response to antibiotics. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'fever' and 'nausea; vomiting', which are present in the GT's negative findings.

        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction provides details about the family (parents deceased, no siblings, nieces/nephews) which implies a non-contributory history, but it doesn't explicitly state 'Non-contributory' as in the GT. It's a different way of expressing a similar idea. [RESULT]: 3",
        "medical_device": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'EpiPen', which is mentioned in the GT's medication list (EpiPen 2-Pak) but not explicitly in a 'medical_device' field. The GT states 'Not recorded' for medical device. The prediction is incorrect based on the GT's specific field value. [RESULT]: 1",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction lists central pancreatectomy, pancreatitis, cholecystectomy, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, carpal tunnel syndrome, and Dupuytren's contracture.

        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists aspirin, omeprazole, EpiPen, medications for blood pressure, medications for cholesterol, and hydrochlorothiazide. The GT lists aspirin, atenolol, epinephrine [EpiPen 2-Pak], hydrochlorothiazide, omalizumab [Xolair], omeprazole. The prediction includes some correct medications (aspirin, omeprazole, EpiPen, hydrochlorothiazide) but generalizes others ('medications for blood pressure', 'medications for cholesterol') and misses omalizumab. It's partially correct. [RESULT]: 3",

        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists some of the medications mentioned in the GT (Aspirin, Calcium, Multivitamins, pills for diabetes which likely refers to glipizide) but misses others (dapsone, sertraline, solifenacin [Vesicare]) and includes 'other unspecified pills'. It is partially correct but incomplete. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The GT focuses on weakness and difficulty getting out of bed. The prediction includes weakness but also adds chest pain details, shortness of breath, and sweating, which are not in the GT's positive findings. The GT's positive findings are only partially represented. [RESULT]: 2",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The GT states a 'full 10 point review of systems otherwise negative'. The prediction lists specific types of chest pain that are denied ('Sharp chest pain; burning chest pain'). While the prediction is a negative finding, it is not the same as the comprehensive negative review of systems mentioned in the GT. [RESULT]: 2"

    "21025648": {
        "occupation": "[REASON]: The prediction accurately reflects the patient's retired status as indicated in the GT. Both state 'Retired'. [RESULT]: 4",
        "exercise": "[REASON]: The prediction mentions limited activity which is consistent with the GT's 'Limited mobility'. The GT specifies 'Gentle walking infrequently', while the prediction mentions 'Used to take long walks; limited lately'. This is a partial match as both indicate reduced activity but differ in the specifics of past and current exercise. [RESULT]: 3",
        "tobacco": "[REASON]: Both the GT and prediction state the patient is a 'Past smoker, quit many years ago'. The prediction adds 'pack a day', which is additional detail but does not contradict the core information in the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "alcohol": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Rarely consumes alcohol'. The prediction states 'Occasional glass of wine with dinner'. Both indicate infrequent alcohol consumption, which is semantically equivalent. [RESULT]: 4",
        "illicit_drug": "[REASON]: The GT states 'None reported'. The prediction states 'Denies use'. Both convey that the patient does not use illicit drugs. [RESULT]: 4",
        "allergies": "[REASON]: Both the GT and prediction list 'Penicillins; Amoxicillin' as allergies. [RESULT]: 4",
        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The GT states 'No known cardiac disease'. The prediction states 'Denies heart disease; Denies diabetes; Children and grandchildren healthy'. The prediction includes the denial of heart disease, which is consistent with the GT, but also includes additional information not present in the GT. [RESULT]: 3",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction lists several conditions that are present in the GT (NSTEMI, Pulmonary hypertension, Osteoarthritis, Breast cancer, Anxiety, Iron deficiency, Reflux, High cholesterol). However, it omits several conditions listed in the GT (CAD s/p NSTEMI, severe pulmonary hypertension, HFpEF, AF, chronic kidney disease, right bundle branch block, HTN, Solitary pulmonary nodule right middle lobe, Coloni polyp, BCC on R cheek). It captures a significant portion but not all of the GT's medical history. [RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT lists 'Chest pain'. The prediction lists 'Chest pressure; Jaw pain'. The prediction includes chest pressure, which is a type of chest pain, and also includes jaw pain, which is mentioned in the positive present illness section of the GT. It captures the primary complaint and a related symptom. [RESULT]: 3",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The GT indicates '0' for pain, which is likely a placeholder or error as the chief complaint is chest pain. The prediction provides specific pain scores for chest pressure and jaw pain. Given the chief complaint, the prediction's inclusion of pain scores is more consistent with the overall clinical picture than the GT's '0'. However, it's not a direct match to the GT's value. [RESULT]: 2",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists most of the medications present in the GT (metoprolol, omeprazole, aspirin, ferrous sulfate, simvastatin, Vitamin B-12, amlodipine, furosemide, multivitamin, Vitamin D3, docusate sodium, melatonin). It omits furosemide from the GT list. It also includes the dosage information for aspirin, which is additional detail. It is a very close match but not exact. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction includes several positive findings mentioned in the GT (chest pressure, awoke at 0230/started 2:30 this morning, pain in R jaw/Jaw pain right side, received 4 aspirin 81mg prior to arrival/Aspirin 81mg (took 4 doses this morning)). It also includes additional positive findings not in the GT (like a tight band, persistent jaw pain, Tired lately, Limited physical activity, Trouble sleeping, Felt like going to pass out). It captures the key positive findings from the GT but also adds others. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The GT lists several negative findings (dyspnea, arm pain, nausea, cough, fever, new edema, symptoms yesterday). The prediction lists 'Denies nausea; Denies sweating; Denies shortness of breath (except for baseline from pulmonary hypertension)'. There is overlap with nausea and dyspnea/shortness of breath, but the prediction omits arm pain, cough, fever, new edema, and symptoms yesterday, and adds sweating. It captures some but not all of the negative findings. [RESULT]: 2"

The information provided is different. [RESULT]: 1",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction captures most of the key medical history items from the ground truth, including stroke, diabetes, hypertension, kidney disease, obesity, sleep apnea, cholecystectomy, lumpectomy, thyroid nodule resection, carpal tunnel surgery, and bilateral blindness. While it doesn't include the detailed descriptions of the stroke infarcts or the specific types of procedures (e.g., laparoscopic simple cholecystectomy), it covers the main conditions and surgeries. [RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction captures the core elements of the chief complaint (weakness, lightheadedness, vision changes) which are consistent with the ground truth (Dizziness, Visual changes). The phrasing is slightly different but the meaning is very similar. [RESULT]: 4",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The ground truth states the pain level is 10. The prediction states the pain level is 7. The values are different. [RESULT]: 1",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists some of the medications from the ground truth (amlodipine, losartan, atenolol, insulin glargine) but misses others (aspirin, cholecalciferol, spironolactone, torsemide, atorvastatin, Plavix). It also adds information about a missed dose of insulin glargine which is not in the ground truth. It is partially correct. [RESULT]: 2",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction includes several positive symptoms from the ground truth (lightheadedness, vision going dark, diarrhea, generalized weakness since previous stroke). It also includes additional symptoms not present in the ground truth (extreme weakness, dizziness, feeling like going to pass out, severe chest pain, squeezing sensation in chest, shaky, confused, foggy mind, parched). It is partially correct. [RESULT]: 2",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction lists headaches and changes in heart rate as negative symptoms. The ground truth lists fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, difficulty speaking, and falls as negative symptoms. There is no overlap between the two lists. [RESULT]: 1"

It includes 'Sleep apnea', 'high blood pressure' (Hypertension), 'thyroid problem' (Papillary thyroid cancer, Graves disease), 'aortic valve problem' (Aortic regurgitation, Strep Viridans Bacteremia with Aortic Valve Endocarditis), 'sinus problem' (Deviated septum, Sinus congestion), and 'gained weight' (Obesity). It misses Gum grafts, High cholesterol, Prostate nodule, and Splenic infarct. [RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction includes 'Weakness' and 'trouble breathing' (Dyspnea), which are the main chief complaints in the GT. It also adds 'cough', which is a positive present illness symptom but not listed as a chief complaint in the GT. [RESULT]: 3",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The GT explicitly states 'pain': 0, while the prediction gives a value of '3 (predicted)'. These are contradictory. [RESULT]: 1",

        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction includes 'Weakness', 'cough', 'white sputum' (productive of whitish, non-bloody sputum), 'tired' (Fatigue), and 'trouble breathing' (Dyspnea with exertion). It also adds 'body feels heavy', 'chest tightness with cough', 'difficulty taking deep breath', 'wakes up many times at night', 'poor sleep', and 'legs feel heavy', which are not explicitly in the GT's positive symptoms. However, the core positive symptoms are captured. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction includes 'No fever', 'no chills', and 'no swelling in legs or feet' (Denies leg swelling). It misses 'Denies currently having dyspnea', 'Denies chest pain', 'Denies nausea', 'Denies vomiting', 'Denies diarrhea', and 'Denies constipation'. It adds 'no night sweats' and 'no pain in legs' which are not in the GT's negative symptoms. [RESULT]: 2"

        "exercise": "[REASON]: The prediction provides a vague description of exercise habits ('walk (used to); homebody') which is partially consistent with the GT's 'Limited mobility; walks short distances indoors'. It captures the idea of limited activity but lacks the specificity of the GT. [RESULT]: 3",
        "tobacco": "[REASON]: The prediction 'denies' is semantically equivalent to the GT 'Never smoked'. [RESULT]: 4",

The GT lists several conditions including 'Overactive bladder' and 'Status post hysterectomy'. The prediction partially captures the bladder issue and the surgery but misses several other conditions listed in the GT. [RESULT]: 2",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT lists 'L Facial droop, L Weakness'. The prediction lists 'fall; left foot pain'. These are related to the events described in the present illness but are not the primary chief complaints as stated in the GT. [RESULT]: 1",

        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'fall (this morning); left foot pain (dull ache, manageable); able to walk; foot redness (possible); watery urine (recent)'. The GT lists 'Left foot pain; fall at home; legs buckled underneath her; difficulty standing up right afterward; difficulty walking afterward due to left foot pain; left foot pain continued to be problematic several hours later; EMS concerned for left facial droop; EMS thought left grip strength slightly decreased; presented to PCP for 'urine more watery than normal'; UCX grew >100K E. faecalis; started on 5 day course of ciprofloxacin'. The prediction captures some key positive findings like the fall, foot pain, and watery urine, but misses significant details like the facial droop, decreased grip strength, and the details of the UTI diagnosis and treatment. [RESULT]: 2",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The GT lists 'Did not notice any trouble using her left hand; did not look in the mirror'.

        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction 'Chest tightness; difficulty breathing' is semantically equivalent to the GT 'Dyspnea, Cough'. Dyspnea means difficulty breathing, and chest tightness is a related symptom often associated with respiratory issues. Cough is also mentioned in the GT. The prediction captures the core complaints. [RESULT]: 3",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'Butalbital-acetaminophen-caf-cod; atenolol; hydrochlorothiazide; pravastatin; aspirin; asthma inhaler (as needed)'. The GT lists 'butalbital-acetaminop-caf-cod, atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, aspirin'. The prediction includes all medications from the GT and adds 'asthma inhaler'. [RESULT]: 3",

The GT lists 'Progressive dry cough; dyspnea; fevers to 101 at home; non-productive cough; chest tightness; ongoing SOB much worse past several days; fevers to 101-102 with chills; HA'. There is significant overlap and semantic equivalence for cough (dry/non-productive), dyspnea/SOB/difficulty breathing, fevers, and chest tightness. The prediction adds more detail and other symptoms like palpitations, weakness, tiredness, anxiety, and feeling like passing out, while missing HA and chills from the GT. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'Sharp chest pain; dull chest pain; productive cough; swelling in legs or feet; leg pain; foot pain; chest pain radiating to arms, neck, or back'. The GT lists 'congestion; chest pain or pressure; n/v/d; abdominal pain; urinary or bowel symptoms; muscle or joint aches'. There is overlap in denying chest pain/pressure and productive cough. However, the prediction misses several items from the GT (congestion, n/v/d, abdominal pain, urinary/bowel symptoms, muscle/joint aches) and includes denials not in the GT (swelling/pain in legs/feet, radiating chest pain).
