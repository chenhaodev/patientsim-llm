The prediction lists 'persistent cough and cold; upper belly pain; shortness of breath; chest pain; abdominal pain; constipation; diarrhea'. While some of these symptoms might be related to ETOH or ILI, the prediction is much more detailed and doesn't directly match the GT's concise chief complaint. [RESULT]: 2",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The GT states the pain score is 0. The prediction states the pain score is 7. These are completely different values. [RESULT]: 1",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'lisinopril; carvedilol; multivitamin (irregularly)'. The GT lists 'lisinopril, carvedilol'. The prediction includes the medications from the GT and adds another one. [RESULT]: 3",

        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction lists several medical conditions present in the GT, including Melanoma Stage IV, low blood sugar, adrenal problem, Diabetes, Prostate issues, Thyroid issues, Heart issues, High blood pressure, and High cholesterol. It omits details like the specific surgeries (bypass, endarterectomy, laminectomy), spinal stenosis, hearing loss, and the denial of PUD. It also rephrases some conditions (e.g., 'Adrenal problem (doctor diagnosed)' for 'Generalized fatigue c/w adrenal insufficiency'). It captures the major conditions but lacks some specificity and completeness. [RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT lists 'HYPOTENSIVE'. The prediction lists 'Weakness; Dizziness; Fever; Nausea'. While hypotension can cause weakness and dizziness, the prediction does not explicitly state hypotension as the chief complaint.

Many of these align semantically (weakness/dizziness related to hypotension/orthostasis, nausea/stomach discomfort related to abdominal discomfort, tiredness related to fatigue, low blood sugar related to hypoglycemia). The prediction also includes the timing relative to chemotherapy and the duration of tiredness/low blood sugar, which adds detail not explicitly in the GT's list but is present in the GT's full text. It captures the key positive findings. [RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The GT lists denial of SOB and palpitations. The prediction lists denial of headache, vision changes, recent infections, and recent illnesses before today. There is no overlap between the negative findings listed. [RESULT]: 1"

        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction mentions 'Heart condition (unspecified type)' which is a very general description compared to the specific conditions listed in the GT ('Nonobstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy; history of nonsustained Ventricular Tachycardia'). It also incorrectly denies surgery, which is not mentioned in the GT as a positive finding. [RESULT]: 2",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction 'Chest pain yesterday' is a slightly more specific description of the chief complaint compared to the GT 'Chest pain', but it accurately reflects the core complaint. [RESULT]: 3",

It also adds more detail about the pain characteristics and duration, and includes urinary frequency and urgency which is listed as a long-standing issue in the prediction's present illness negative section. While it adds extra details not explicitly in the GT's positive section, it captures the core positive findings. [RESULT]: 3",

        "medical_device": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Not recorded', while the prediction lists 'stent in right coronary artery'. This information is present in the medical history in the GT, but not explicitly listed as a medical device. The prediction extracts this information and places it under medical device, which is a reasonable interpretation, but not directly stated in the GT's medical device field. [RESULT]: 2",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction includes all the medical history items listed in the GT, using slightly different but semantically equivalent terms (e.g., overweight instead of obesity, high blood pressure instead of HTN). [RESULT]: 4",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'abdominal pain' and 'bloating'. The GT lists 'Abd pain, Nausea'. While abdominal pain is present in both, bloating is not explicitly listed as a chief complaint in the GT, and nausea is missing from the prediction. [RESULT]: 3",

It misses some details like the specific timing of nausea/vomiting resolution and return, and the description of heaving. It also adds 'pain with movement, feels like something shifting inside' which is not in the GT. [RESULT]: 3",

Both indicate the absence of certain significant conditions in the family history. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'High blood pressure; Kidney problem; Gout; Sleep problem', which are all present in the GT's more detailed list (HTN, CKD, Gout, OSA). The prediction captures the key conditions. [RESULT]: 4",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'Dizzy; Almost fell down', which are consistent with the GT's 'Hypertension, Presyncope'. Presyncope is the medical term for feeling like one is going to faint or almost falling down, and dizziness is a related symptom. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'Pills for blood pressure; Aspirin; Something for gout'. The GT lists specific medications: allopurinol (for gout), amlodipine and irbesartan (for blood pressure), and aspirin. The prediction captures the categories of medications but not all the specific names. [RESULT]: 3",

However, it misses several specific medications (clopidogrel, lamotrigine, ranitidine, rosuvastatin) and uses general categories for others. It also notes the patient has a list but doesn't know names, which is additional information not in the GT. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction includes many positive symptoms mentioned in the GT (stomach pain/abdominal pain, diarrhea, chest hurt/chest pain, sick feeling/nausea, throw up/N/V). It also adds significant detail and other related symptoms (pain characteristics, frequency of diarrhea/vomiting, tired, pain make tired, lose weight, no appetite, chills, urine hurt sometimes) which are not in the GT but are plausible related symptoms. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'fever' and 'cough' as negative symptoms.

The prediction's 'smokes sometimes' adds information not explicitly in the GT, but the 'Used to smoke' aligns with the history. It's partially correct but adds potentially inaccurate information about current use. [RESULT]: 3",

These are all present and significant items in the ground truth's detailed medical history. It omits hypothyroidism, ulcerative colitis, c diff colitis, medically refractory panulcerative colitis s/p proctocolectomy and J-pouch anal anastomosis, recurrent pouch problems, and c. diffitis, but captures the most prominent and currently relevant issues (pouchitis, surgery/J-pouch, depression). [RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'Stomach problems; big and hard belly; vomiting; constipation'. The ground truth lists 'Constipation'.

        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists Ciprofloxacin, levothyroxine, citalopram, loperamide, Imodium, and Metamucil. The ground truth lists ciprofloxacin HCl, citalopram, dicyclomine, levothyroxine, loperamide, loperamide-simethicone, norethindrone-e.estradiol-iron, tramadol, and valacyclovir. The prediction includes several correct medications (Ciprofloxacin, levothyroxine, citalopram, loperamide) and mentions Imodium and Metamucil which are used by the patient according to the PI.

The ground truth lists progressive abdominal distention, absence of BM, intermittent flatus, nausea, repetitive episodes of NBNB vomiting, dependence on ciprofloxacin, uses Imodium, intermittently uses Metamucil. There is overlap in constipation, vomiting, and abdominal distention/bloating. The prediction includes some symptoms not explicitly listed in the GT (tired, weak, tight/uncomfortable feeling) and misses others (flatus, nausea, dependence on cipro, use of Imodium/Metamucil). [RESULT]: 3",

The prediction mentions mother and mother's sister having breast cancer and father having high blood pressure. The breast cancer information is consistent, but the prediction adds father's history and omits the lack of stroke history. [RESULT]: 3",
        "medical_device": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Not recorded'. The prediction mentions the ProAir HFA inhaler, which is listed under medications in the GT. While the GT says 'Not recorded', the prediction provides information that is present elsewhere in the GT profile. This is a discrepancy in how the information is categorized, but the information itself is present in the overall profile. [RESULT]: 2",

The prediction lists Dizziness, left side facial drooping, drooling on left side, difficulty holding spoon with left hand, left hand kept dropping, strange sensations in feet (pins and needles), unsteady when walking, and feeling a bit more tired than usual. Many symptoms are consistent (dizziness, facial droop, drooling, difficulty with left hand/dropping spoon, paresthesias/strange sensations in feet, imbalance/unsteady when walking). The prediction provides more detail on some symptoms and adds feeling tired, while the GT mentions intermittent paresthesias bilateral feet specifically. Overall, there is significant overlap and semantic equivalence. [RESULT]: 4",

        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists some of the medications from the GT but misses several (azithromycin, lorazepam, multivitamin, Omega-3 Fatty Acids, omeprazole, Calcium Magnesium + D). It also uses brand names for some medications where the GT uses generic names. [RESULT]: 2",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction captures many of the positive symptoms and their timelines mentioned in the GT, such as throat tightness, productive cough, weakness, fatigue, and fever. It also adds 'white mucus' and 'decreased appetite' which are not in the GT. It misses the detail about shoveling snow and the temperature value. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction lists several denied symptoms, some of which are not explicitly mentioned as denied in the GT (dry cough, yellow mucus, green mucus, chest pain).

        "tobacco": "[REASON]: The prediction indicates current smoking, which aligns with the GT's report of current tobacco use. The GT specifies type and amount are not specified, and the prediction also lacks this detail. The prediction adds 'trying to cut back', which is not in the GT but doesn't contradict it. Overall, the core information about current use is consistent.\n[RESULT]: 4",
        "alcohol": "[REASON]: The prediction states 'history of issues, not sure if actively using', which is semantically equivalent to the GT's 'History of alcohol abuse; current status not specified'. Both indicate a past history and uncertainty about current use.\n[RESULT]: 4",
        "illicit_drug": "[REASON]: The prediction mentions 'history of polysubstance abuse, including cocaine, working on getting under control'. This is consistent with the GT's 'History of polysubstance abuse including cocaine; current status not specified'. Both mention the history and polysubstance abuse including cocaine, and the prediction's 'working on getting under control' implies the current status is not fully resolved, aligning with the GT's 'current status not specified'.\n[RESULT]: 4",
        "allergies": "[REASON]: The prediction lists Motrin, Codeine, Sulfa antibiotics, and lactose intolerant. The GT lists Motrin, Codeine, lactose, and Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics). The prediction accurately captures all the allergies listed in the GT, using slightly different phrasing for Sulfa and lactose but with the same meaning.\n[RESULT]: 4",
        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction states 'none', while the GT specifies 'No family history of cancer; no HTN; no chronic lung diseases'. The prediction is a simplification of the GT, stating the absence of family history but not providing the specific conditions mentioned in the GT. It is partially correct in that there is no significant family history mentioned in the GT, but it lacks the detail.\n[RESULT]: 3",
        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction lists pneumonia, back pain, joint pain in knees and ankles, HIV, hypertension, neuropathic pain, depression, and anxiety. The GT lists HIV, HTN, depression, gout, Prior PE (per pt), Traumatic brain injury, Left pupillary tear as child, blind in left eye, History of polysubstance abuse (including EtOH, cocaine), H/o suicide attempts, multiple Psychiatric hospitalizations, and pneumonia (recent admission). The prediction includes some key elements (pneumonia, HIV, HTN, depression) but misses several significant items like gout, PE, TBI, eye injury, polysubstance abuse history, suicide attempts, and psychiatric hospitalizations. It also includes 'neuropathic pain' and 'anxiety' which are not explicitly listed in the GT's medical history section, although anxiety could be related to the psychiatric history. The prediction is only partially consistent.\n[RESULT]: 2",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT lists 'Dyspnea, Productive cough'. The prediction lists 'chest pain; shortness of breath'. The prediction includes shortness of breath (dyspnea) but misses the productive cough and includes chest pain, which is listed under present illness positive in the GT, not as a chief complaint. The prediction is only partially correct.\n[RESULT]: 2",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The GT indicates '0' for pain, implying no pain is reported as a general assessment. The prediction states '2 or 3', suggesting a low level of pain. These are inconsistent. The GT's 'pain: 0' likely refers to a general pain score, while the prediction's '2 or 3' might be an interpretation based on the reported chest and back pain in the present illness, but it contradicts the explicit '0' in the GT.\n[RESULT]: 1",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists Norvir, Truvada, Reyataz, amlodipine, and gabapentin. The GT lists Norvir, Truvada, amlodipine, gabapentin, and Reyataz. The lists are identical, just in a slightly different order.\n[RESULT]: 4",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The GT lists detailed information about chest pain, SOB, back pain, joint pain, and prior pneumonia symptoms. The prediction includes chest pain (with some details matching the GT), shortness of breath, back pain (linked to pneumonia), joint pain (linked to HIV), fatigue (not in GT), trouble sleeping (not in GT), and hemoptysis (during pneumonia, which is in the GT's prior pneumonia symptoms). The prediction captures some key positive findings but misses details and includes items not explicitly listed in the GT's positive findings section.\n[RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The GT lists denial of stomach pain, acid reflux symptoms, trauma (for chest pain), cough, fevers, and nasal congestion. The prediction lists denial of sweating, nausea, dizziness, significant weight changes, prolonged fever, and increased anxiety or stress. There is overlap with denial of fever, but the other denied symptoms are different. The prediction does not capture most of the negative findings listed in the GT.\n[RESULT]: 1"

It also includes many additional positive symptoms which are not in the ground truth. While it captures the GT information, the extensive additional information makes it only partially consistent with the specific items listed in the GT. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'chest pain', 'nausea', 'vomiting', and 'diarrhea' as negative symptoms, which are present in the ground truth. It misses 'h/a', 'dizzyness', 'presyncope', 'dyspnea', 'abdominal pain', 'dysuria', 'polyuria', and 'foamy urine'.

        "allergies": "[REASON]: The prediction lists 'Iodine; medicine starting with 'C''. The GT lists 'Iodine-Iodine Containing; carvedilol; doxycycline'. The prediction correctly identifies Iodine but only partially captures the medication allergies by mentioning 'medicine starting with 'C'' instead of the specific names. [RESULT]: 2",
        "family_medical_history": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Not recorded'. The prediction provides information about the mother's death, which is a family medical history detail. This contradicts the GT's statement that it's not recorded. [RESULT]: 1",

This captures several key points from the GT (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, abd distention, loose stools, last BM yesterday, last flatus last night) but also includes additional details and misses some specifics like the number of vomiting episodes. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Not recorded'. The prediction provides negative findings ('No fever; No blood in stool; No weight loss; No recent travel').

        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction mentions 'Heart problem; Diabetes'. The GT lists 'CAD s/p CABG' (Coronary Artery Disease after bypass surgery, a heart problem) and 'DM2' (Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus). It misses the prostate cancer and cataracts. Therefore, it is partially correct. [RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT states 'S/P CVA' (Status Post Cerebrovascular Accident, or stroke). The prediction lists symptoms like 'Face and arm numbness; Headache; Ear ringing; Walking funny'. While these symptoms are related to a potential CVA, the chief complaint in the GT is the event itself. The prediction describes the symptoms leading to the chief complaint rather than the chief complaint itself. [RESULT]: 2",
        "pain": "[REASON]: The prediction '0' is an exact match to the GT. [RESULT]: 4",
        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists general categories ('Pill for heart; Pill for sugar') while the GT lists specific medications (atorvastatin, lisinopril, metoprolol tartrate for heart/blood pressure; glyburide for sugar). The prediction is only partially correct as it doesn't list all medications or their specific names. [RESULT]: 2",

The ground truth lists 'paroxysmal AFib' and 'SVT s/p ablation' which relate to heart problems, and 'CVA (embolic stroke treated with TPA, no residual deficits)' which is a stroke. While the prediction captures some aspects, it is very general and misses many other significant medical history items from the ground truth. [RESULT]: 2",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The ground truth chief complaint is 'Failure to thrive'. The prediction lists 'Family says acting different; No feel good; No want take medicine'. While these might be related to failure to thrive, they are not the specific chief complaint listed in the ground truth. [RESULT]: 2",

The prediction lists behavioral observations from the family ('Family says acting different', 'Tired', 'Eating little', etc.). While some of the predicted items might be related to the ground truth findings (e.g., 'agitation' and 'Angry'), the prediction is a layperson's description and does not capture the clinical details in the ground truth.

        "medication": "[REASON]: The prediction lists several medications from the GT (lisinopril, etravirine, lamivudine, raltegravir) and mentions insulin, which is implied by the GT's mention of 'diabetes (insulin requiring)'. However, it misses several other medications listed in the GT (azelastine, blood-glucose meter, blood sugar diagnostic, lancets, loratadine, pravastatin, quetiapine) and includes the mother's medication which is not the patient's. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_positive": "[REASON]: The prediction captures the core positive findings from the GT (pain in left arm moving to chest, woke from sleep, similar event 8 months ago). It adds details like 'getting worse', 'squeezing, tight feeling', 'hard to breathe (feels like)', 'started this morning', 'anxious', 'heart racing', and 'more exhausted than usual lately', some of which are elaborations or potentially inferred but not explicitly in the GT's positive findings list. [RESULT]: 3",

        "medical_history": "[REASON]: The prediction lists most of the conditions from the GT (HCV, HTN, Appendectomy, Seborrheic keratosis removal L eye, chronic pelvic infections, TAHBSO). The GT mentions TAHBSO for chronic pelvic infections, and the prediction lists them separately but includes both. The prediction adds 'arrhythmia', which is not in the GT. Overall, most of the GT information is present, but there's an addition. [RESULT]: 3",
        "chiefcomplaint": "[REASON]: The GT lists 'Chest pain' as the chief complaint. The prediction lists multiple symptoms (sore throat, cough, generalized weakness, heavy legs, trouble maintaining balance, unsteadiness, epigastric pain, chills) but does not explicitly list 'Chest pain' as the chief complaint, although epigastric pain is mentioned. The primary chief complaint from the GT is missing. [RESULT]: 1",

It also includes additional details and symptoms not present in the GT (dull/aching/tickle sore throat, dry/hacking cough with mucus, cough worsening when lying down/bending over, tight sensation in chest, persistent/waxing/waning epigastric pain, chills especially in evenings/when fatigued, fatigue, memory issues, bloating, discomfort after eating, decreased appetite, weight loss, altered taste/smell, vivid dreams, restlessness, hot/sweaty at night). While it includes the GT items, it adds a significant amount of extra information. [RESULT]: 3",
        "present_illness_negative": "[REASON]: The GT states 'Fevers at home denied; Other symptoms per 10-point ROS denied (except HPI)'. The prediction states 'fever (checked temperature with wrist, felt normal); blood in mucus; severe reaction to dairy or gluten; severe reaction to insect bites/stings; severe reaction to latex/medical supplies'. The prediction denies fever, which aligns with the GT. However, it lists specific denied symptoms that are not explicitly mentioned as denied in the GT's general statement about the 10-point ROS. The prediction is partially consistent by denying fever but adds other specific denials not in the GT. [RESULT]: 3"
